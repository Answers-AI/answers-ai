Code Explanation:
- The code exports a function named `config` that takes in a parameter `CODE_BASE_PATH`.
- The function returns an object that contains various paths and configurations used by the `docubot` tool.
- The `path` module is used to join different paths and create file paths.
- The object contains an array of invalid paths, file types, and file names that should be ignored by `docubot`.
- The object also contains an object named `fileTypes` that defines the different types of files that `docubot` can handle. Each file type has its own set of properties such as `fileTypes`, `prompt`, and `template`.
- The code exports the `config` function.
