What is the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application?
A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that are used to configure a larger application. These settings can include things like database connection strings, API keys, and other application-specific settings. Configuration files are typically used to make it easier to deploy and manage an application, as they allow developers to change settings without having to recompile the entire application.
