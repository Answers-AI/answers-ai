Summary:
This file is a Git ignore file located in the "web" directory of the application. It is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git when committing changes.

Dependencies:
This file does not have any dependencies.

Code Summary:
The code in this file is very simple. It specifies two items to be ignored by Git: the "node_modules" directory and the ".env" file. The "node_modules" directory contains all of the dependencies for the application, which can be installed using the "npm install" command. The ".env" file contains environment variables that should not be committed to version control.

Interaction Summary:
This file does not interact with any other parts of the application directly. However, it is an important part of the development process because it ensures that sensitive information (such as environment variables) are not accidentally committed to version control.

Developer Questions:
- What other files and directories should be ignored by Git?
- How can I add additional files or directories to the Git ignore list?
- What happens if I accidentally commit a file that should have been ignored?
