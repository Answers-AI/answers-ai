Summary:
This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for a Node.js web application. It installs the pnpm package manager and uses it to install the application's dependencies. It then exposes port 3000 and starts the application in development mode.

Dependencies:
- Node.js v18
- pnpm
- turbo

Code Summary:
1. Sets the base image to Node.js v18.
2. Sets the working directory to /app.
3. Installs pnpm and turbo globally.
4. Copies the package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml files to the working directory.
5. Runs pnpm install to install the application's dependencies.
6. Copies all files in the current directory to the working directory.
7. Exposes port 3000.
8. Starts the application in development mode using pnpm.

Interaction Summary:
This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for a Node.js web application. It can be used in conjunction with other Dockerfiles and configuration files to deploy the application to a production environment. The resulting Docker image can be run in a container to serve the web application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the turbo package?
- Why is pnpm being used instead of npm or yarn?
- How can I modify the Dockerfile to run the application in production mode?
- How can I configure the application to use a different port?
