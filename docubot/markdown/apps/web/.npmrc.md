Code Summary:
The code in this file sets several configuration options for npm. The "auto-install-peers" option tells npm to automatically install any peer dependencies that a package requires. The "link-workspace-packages" option tells npm to create symbolic links to packages in the same workspace, rather than installing them separately. The "save-workspace-protocol" option sets the protocol used when saving packages in the workspace. Finally, the "public-hoist-pattern" option specifies which packages should be hoisted to the top-level node_modules directory when installing packages.

The settings in this file affect how npm installs and manages packages, which can have a significant impact on the application's behavior. For example, the "auto-install-peers" option can prevent errors caused by missing peer dependencies, while the "public-hoist-pattern" option can help reduce the size of the application's node_modules directory.
