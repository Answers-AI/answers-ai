Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

This configuration file is used to specify various settings and dependencies for a web application. It contains information such as the application name, version, and scripts for development, building, starting, and linting the application. It also lists all the dependencies required for the application to run, including their version numbers. 

This file is important because it allows developers to easily manage and maintain the application's dependencies and settings. By specifying all the dependencies in one place, it makes it easier to install and update them. Additionally, by having all the settings in one file, it makes it easier to configure the application for different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

Developers working with this file may have questions such as:
- What is the purpose of each script listed in the file?
- What is the purpose of each dependency listed in the file?
- How do I add or remove a dependency from the file?
- How do I configure the application for different environments using this file?
