API Summary:
This file exports an API endpoint for the Inngest service, which is used to send and receive events. It includes various internal functions for handling different types of events, as well as external services such as Algolia, Confluence, and Slack.

Import statements:
- `Inngest` from the `inngest` library: used to create a client for sending and receiving events
- `serve` from the `inngest/next` library: used to create an API endpoint for the Inngest service
- Various internal functions from the `@utils/ingest` module: used to handle different types of events

Internal Functions:
- `handlers`: an object containing all of the internal functions for handling different types of events
- `functions`: an array of all the internal functions from `handlers`
- `inngest`: a new instance of the `Inngest` client, with the name "My App"
- `inngestFunctions`: an object containing all of the internal functions from `functions`, wrapped in a format that can be used by the `serve` function
- `createInngestFunctions`: a utility function for wrapping internal functions in a format that can be used by the `serve` function

External Services:
- Algolia
- Confluence
- Slack

API Endpoints:
POST /api/inngest
Summary: This endpoint is used to send events to the Inngest service.
Example Usage:
```
const response = await fetch('/api/inngest', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ type: 'my-event', data: { foo: 'bar' } }),
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
});
const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```
Example Response:
```
{ success: true }
```

Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can use the `fetch` API to send events to the Inngest service by making a POST request to the `/api/inngest` endpoint. The request body should be a JSON object with a `type` property indicating the type of event being sent, and a `data` property containing any additional data associated with the event.

Developer Questions:
- What types of events can be handled by the internal functions in this file?
- How are events processed and stored by the Inngest service?
- What is the purpose of the `signingKey` option passed to the `serve` function?
- How can I add new internal functions for handling additional types of events?
