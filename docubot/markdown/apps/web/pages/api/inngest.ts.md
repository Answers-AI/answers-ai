This file is a module that exports a default function that creates an Inngest server and serves it using the Next.js framework. Inngest is a library for building event-driven applications. The server is created by passing a name for the application and an object containing event handler functions to the Inngest constructor. The event handler functions are imported from various modules and combined into a single object using the spread operator. The resulting object is passed to the Inngest constructor as the event handlers.

Import statements:
- `Inngest` is imported from the `inngest` module.
- `serve` is imported from the `inngest/next` module.
- `createInngestFunctions` is imported from the `@utils/ingest/EventVersionHandler` module.
- Various event handler functions are imported from modules in the `@utils/ingest` namespace.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Services:

API Endpoints:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file serves as the entry point for the Inngest server. It creates an instance of the Inngest class and passes it a set of event handler functions. These functions are responsible for processing events that are sent to the server. The server is then served using the Next.js framework.

Developer Questions:
- What events are handled by the event handler functions?
- How are events processed by the server?
- How can I add additional event handler functions to the server?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- None
