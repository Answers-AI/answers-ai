API Summary:
This file contains an API endpoint for handling a stream of messages between a user and an AI chatbot. It uses the OpenAIStream utility function to handle the stream and getCompletionRequest to generate completion requests for the OpenAI API.

Import statements:
- OpenAIStream: a utility function for handling streams of messages between a user and an AI chatbot
- cors: a middleware for handling CORS requests
- AnswersFilters, Message: types used in the API endpoint
- getCompletionRequest: a utility function for generating completion requests for the OpenAI API

Internal Functions:
- handler: the main function for the API endpoint, which handles the stream of messages between a user and an AI chatbot. It takes in a request object and returns a response object. It first checks if the request method is OPTIONS and returns a CORS response if it is. It then extracts the prompt, messages, and filters from the request body and sends a POST request to the /api/ai/prompt endpoint with these parameters. It then uses the response from this request to generate a completion request using getCompletionRequest and sends this completion request to the OpenAIStream function. It returns a CORS response with the stream from the OpenAIStream function.

External Services:
- OpenAI API: used to generate completion requests for the AI chatbot

API Endpoints:
POST /api/ai/stream
Summary: Handles a stream of messages between a user and an AI chatbot. Takes in a prompt, messages, and filters from the request body and sends a POST request to the /api/ai/prompt endpoint with these parameters. Uses the response from this request to generate a completion request using getCompletionRequest and sends this completion request to the OpenAIStream function. Returns a CORS response with the stream from the OpenAIStream function.
Example Usage:
```
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/stream', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ prompt, messages, filters })
}).then((res) => res.json());
```

Example Response:
```
ReadableStream {}
```

Interaction Summary:
This API endpoint can be used by a client-side chatbot component to handle a stream of messages between a user and an AI chatbot. The component can send a POST request to the /api/ai/stream endpoint with the prompt, messages, and filters as parameters, and then use the stream returned by the API endpoint to display the chatbot's responses to the user.

Developer Questions:
- How is the OpenAIStream function implemented, and what parameters does it take?
- What is the format of the response from the /api/ai/prompt endpoint, and how is it used to generate a completion request?
- What is the purpose of the AnswersFilters and Message types, and how are they used in the API endpoint?
- How can the API endpoint be modified to handle different types of AI chatbots or completion models?
