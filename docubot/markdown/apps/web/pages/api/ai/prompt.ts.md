API Summary:
This file contains an API endpoint for handling requests related to OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The endpoint receives a request with a context and returns a response generated by the language model.

Import statements:
- NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse from 'next': These are types from the Next.js framework for handling API requests and responses.
- Configuration and OpenAIApi from 'openai': These are classes from the OpenAI API for initializing and interacting with the GPT-3 language model.
- cors from '@ui/cors': This is a middleware for handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) requests.
- fetchContext from '@utils/pinecone/fetchContext': This is a utility function for fetching context data from a Pinecone database.

Internal Functions:
- initializeOpenAI(): This function initializes the OpenAI API with the API key stored in the environment variables.
- handler(): This function is the main API endpoint handler. It receives a request with a context, generates a response using the GPT-3 language model, and returns the response.

External Services:
- OpenAI API: This endpoint interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses using the GPT-3 language model.
- Pinecone database: This endpoint uses the fetchContext utility function to fetch context data from a Pinecone database.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/ai/prompt
Summary: This endpoint receives a request with a context and generates a response using the GPT-3 language model.
Example Usage:
```
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/prompt', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({

```
{
  "response": "The quick brown fox jumps over the fence."
}
```
Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can send a POST request to this endpoint with a context and a prompt. The endpoint will generate a response using the GPT-3 language model and return it in the response. The client-side component can then use the response to update the UI or perform other actions.

Developer Questions:
- How is the context data fetched from the Pinecone database?
- How can I customize the OpenAI API configuration for this endpoint?
- What happens if the OpenAI API key is not set in the environment variables?
