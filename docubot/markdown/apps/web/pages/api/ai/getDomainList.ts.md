This file is a Next.js API route that handles requests to retrieve a list of domains. It uses the Next.js API route handler function to handle incoming requests and return responses. 

Import statements:
- `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` are imported from the `next` module to define the types of the request and response objects.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module to retrieve the user session from the server.
- `cors` is imported from the `@ui/cors` module to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API route.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module to configure the authentication options for the session.
- `getDomainList` is imported from the `@ui/chat/getDomainList` module to retrieve the list of domains.

Internal Functions:
- `handler` is an asynchronous function that takes in a `NextApiRequest` object and a `NextApiResponse` object as parameters. It first enables CORS for the API route using the `cors` function. It then retrieves the user session from the server using the `getServerSession` function and the `authOptions` configuration. If the user session does not contain an email, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response. Otherwise, it retrieves the list of domains using the `getDomainList` function and returns a 200 OK response with the list of domains in the response body.

External Services:
- This API endpoint works with the `next-auth` module to retrieve the user session from the server and the `@ui/chat/getDomainList` module to retrieve the list of domains.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/domains
Summary: Retrieves a list of domains.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the `next-auth` module to retrieve the user session from the server and the `@ui/chat/getDomainList` module to retrieve the list of domains.

Developer Questions:
- What authentication options are configured in the `authOptions` module?
- What is the structure of the user session object returned by the `getServerSession` function?
- What is the format of the list of domains returned by the `getDomainList` function?
