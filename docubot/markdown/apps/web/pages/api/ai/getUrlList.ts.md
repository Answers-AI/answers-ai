API Summary:
This API endpoint retrieves a list of URLs based on the user's session and optional domain parameters.

Import statements:
- NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse from 'next': These are types from the Next.js framework for handling API requests and responses.
- getServerSession from 'next-auth': This is a function from the NextAuth.js library for retrieving the user's session on the server-side.
- cors from '@ui/cors': This is a middleware function for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the API endpoint.
- authOptions from '@ui/authOptions': This is an object containing options for authenticating the user's session.
- getUrlList from '@ui/chat/getUrlList': This is a function for retrieving a list of URLs based on optional domain parameters.

Internal Functions:
- handler: This is the main function for the API endpoint. It takes in a NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse as parameters, and returns a Promise that resolves to a Data object containing a list of URLs. It first enables CORS on the API endpoint, then retrieves the user's session using getServerSession and authOptions. If the user is not authenticated, it returns a 401 Unauthorized status code. Otherwise, it retrieves the optional domain parameters from the request body and passes them to getUrlList to retrieve a list of URLs. It then returns a 200 OK status code with the list of URLs in the response body.

External Services:
- NextAuth.js: This library is used for authenticating the user's session.
