Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "../../node_modules/.pnpm/typescript@4.9.5/node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true
}

Summary:
This file is a configuration file that is used to specify certain settings for the TypeScript language server in a larger application.

Service:
The TypeScript language server is a tool that provides code intelligence for TypeScript files in an editor or IDE. It can provide features such as code completion, error checking, and refactoring tools.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file specifies the location of the TypeScript library and enables the use of the workspace version of the TypeScript language server.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "typescript.tsdk": This setting specifies the location of the TypeScript library that the language server should use. In this case, it is set to a specific version of TypeScript installed in the project's node_modules directory.
- "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": This setting enables the use of the workspace version of the TypeScript language server, which is installed in the project's workspace rather than globally.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript language server to provide code intelligence for TypeScript files in the application. By specifying the location of the TypeScript library and enabling the use of the workspace version of the language server, developers can ensure that the language server is using the correct version of TypeScript and is installed in the correct location.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of this configuration file?
- How does changing the "typescript.tsdk" setting affect the behavior of the language server?
- What is the difference between the global and workspace versions of the TypeScript language server?
- How can I troubleshoot issues with the TypeScript language server in my editor or IDE?
