This file is a TypeScript module that exports a single function called `POST`. It is responsible for handling HTTP POST requests to a specific API endpoint. The function expects a JSON payload with a `keywords` property in the request body.

Import statements:
- `getAppSettings` is a function imported from `@ui/getAppSettings` module. It is used to retrieve application settings.
- `getServerSession` is a function imported from `next-auth` module. It is used to retrieve the user session.
- `authOptions` is an object imported from `@ui/authOptions` module. It contains options for authentication.
- `inngest` is an object imported from `@utils/ingest/client` module. It is used to send data to an external service.
- `NextResponse` is a class imported from `next/server` module. It is used to construct HTTP responses.

Internal Functions:
- `POST`: This function is an async function that takes two parameters, `req` and `res`. It first retrieves the application settings and user session using the imported functions. It then extracts the `keywords` property from the request body using `await req.json()`. Finally, it sends data to an external service using `inngest.send()` and returns a JSON response using `NextResponse.json()`.

External Services:
- This file interacts with an external service called `inngest` to send data.

API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/route`
Summary: This endpoint is responsible for handling HTTP POST requests to a specific API endpoint. It expects a JSON payload with a `keywords` property in the request body.

}'
```
Example Response:

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with other parts of the application by retrieving application settings and user session. It also sends data to an external service.

Developer Questions:
- What is the external service `inngest` and how does it work?
- What happens if the `getAppSettings` or `getServerSession` functions fail to retrieve data?
- What other API endpoints does this file interact with?
