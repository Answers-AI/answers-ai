Client-side components can use the GET endpoint to retrieve all chat records associated with the currently logged in user and display them in the UI. The DELETE endpoint can be used to delete a specific chat record when the user clicks a "delete" button or performs a similar action.

Developer Questions:
- How are chat records associated with users in the database?
- What other API endpoints are available for working with chat data?
- How can I add authentication to other API endpoints in the application?
