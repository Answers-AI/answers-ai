API Endpoints:
GET /api/prompts
Summary: Retrieves all prompts associated with the currently logged in user.

        "email": "user@example.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

DELETE /api/prompts?id={id}

Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can use these API endpoints to retrieve, delete, and update prompts associated with the currently logged in user. For example, a dashboard component could use the GET endpoint to display a list of prompts, and a prompt detail component could use the DELETE and PATCH endpoints to allow the user to delete or update a specific prompt.

Developer Questions:
- What database is being used with Prisma?
- How are the authOptions configured for next-auth?
- What other API endpoints exist in the application that interact with prompts?
- What fields are allowed to be updated in the PATCH endpoint?
