Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can use the GET endpoint to retrieve all journey records associated with the authenticated user and display them in the UI. The DELETE endpoint can be used to delete a specific journey record associated with the authenticated user, for example when the user clicks a "delete" button on a journey card.

Developer Questions:
- How are journey records associated with users in the database?
- What happens if the user is not authenticated when making a request to these endpoints?
- How can I modify the WHERE clause in the Prisma queries to filter journey records differently?
