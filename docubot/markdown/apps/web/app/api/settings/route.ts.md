API Summary:
This file contains two API endpoints, one for GET requests and one for POST requests. The GET endpoint retrieves the current app settings and returns them as a JSON response. The POST endpoint updates the app settings with the data provided in the request body and returns the updated app settings as a JSON response.

Import statements:
- NextResponse: a class from the next/server module that provides a way to send responses to HTTP requests
- getServerSession: a function from the next-auth module that retrieves the user session from the server
- deepmerge: a function from the @utils/deepmerge module that merges two objects deeply
- prisma: an instance of the Prisma client for interacting with the database
- authOptions: an object containing options for the getServerSession function
- getAppSettings: a function from the @ui/getAppSettings module that retrieves the current app settings

Internal Functions:
- GET: an async function that handles GET requests to the /api/settings route. It retrieves the current app settings and returns them as a JSON response.
- POST: an async function that handles POST requests to the /api/settings route. It updates the app settings with the data provided in the request body and returns the updated app settings as a JSON response.

External Services:
- Prisma: a database client that allows the application to interact with the database.

Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can interact with the GET endpoint to retrieve the current app settings and use them to configure the application. They can also interact with the POST endpoint to update the app settings with new values.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the app settings object?
- How are app settings validated and sanitized before being stored in the database?
- What is the purpose of the authOptions object?
- How are user permissions enforced when updating app settings?
