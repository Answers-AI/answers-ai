This file contains two API endpoints, one for GET requests and one for POST requests. The GET endpoint retrieves the application settings and returns them as a JSON response. The POST endpoint updates the application settings for the authenticated user and returns the updated settings as a JSON response.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` package and is used to create responses for Next.js API routes.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` package and is used to retrieve the user session for the authenticated user.
- `deepmerge` is imported from the `@utils/deepmerge` package and is used to merge the existing application settings with the updated settings.
- `prisma` is imported from the `db/dist` package and is used to interact with the database.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This function handles GET requests to the API endpoint. It retrieves the application settings using the `getAppSettings` function and returns them as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.
- `POST`: This function handles POST requests to the API endpoint. It retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and checks if the user is authenticated. If the user is authenticated, it retrieves the user's current application settings from the database using `prisma.user.findUnique`. It then merges the existing settings with the updated settings using `deepmerge` and updates the user's application settings in the database using `prisma.user.update`. Finally, it returns the updated application settings as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- This file interacts with the `next-auth` package to retrieve the user session and authenticate the user.
- This file interacts with the `db/dist` package to retrieve and update the user's application settings in the database.

API Endpoints:
- GET /api/settings
Summary: Retrieves the application settings for the authenticated user.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/settings \

  }
}
```

```
Example Response:
```json

}
```

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the `next-auth` package and the `db/dist` package to authenticate the user and retrieve and update the user's application settings in the database. It also uses the `NextResponse` package to create responses for the API endpoints.

Developer Questions:
- How are the application settings stored in the database?
- How can I add validation to ensure that the user has organization update access before updating the application settings?
- Why is the code for updating the organization's application settings commented out?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There are two TODO comments in the code related to validating user access and enabling user settings. These should be addressed before deploying the code to production.
- The code for updating the organization's application settings is currently commented out. This should be addressed before deploying the code to production.
