This file contains the configuration for Vite, a build tool for modern web applications. It imports the `defineConfig` function from the Vite library and the `preact` plugin from the `@preact/preset-vite` package.

The `vite_config_default` object is defined using `defineConfig` and contains configuration options for the Vite build process. The `build` object specifies the output directory and rollup options for the build, while the `plugins` array includes the `preact` plugin with options to disable devtools and hot module replacement.

This file is used to configure the build process for the AnswerAIChatWidget, a chat widget for the Answers AI platform.
