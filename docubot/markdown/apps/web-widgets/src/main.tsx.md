Summary:
This React file initializes and renders the AnswersAI chat widget in a target element on a webpage.

Import statements:
The file imports the `render` function from the `preact` library and the `App` component from a local file.

Component:
The `AnswersAI` object is created with an `init` method that takes an object with `iframeSrc` and `targetId` properties as its argument. The method checks if `iframeSrc` is provided and if a target element with the given `targetId` exists. If both conditions are met, the `render` function is called with the `App` component and the `iframeSrc` prop passed as props.

Rendered components:
