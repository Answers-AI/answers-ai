Purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application:

A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that define how a larger application should behave. These settings can include anything from database connection information to application-specific settings like the number of threads to use for processing requests. The purpose of a configuration file is to allow developers to easily modify the behavior of an application without having to modify the code itself. This makes it easier to maintain and update the application over time.
