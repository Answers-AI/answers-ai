## Description
This file (`vite.config.ts`) is used to configure the Vite build tool for the Sidekick AI project. It imports the `react` and `crx` plugins and exports a default configuration object.

The `manifest.json` file contains the default manifest for the Sidekick AI Chrome extension. It specifies the name, version, and permissions required by the extension.

## Usage
This file should not be modified unless you are familiar with the Vite build tool and the Sidekick AI project. If you need to make changes to the extension manifest, modify the `manifest.json` file instead.
