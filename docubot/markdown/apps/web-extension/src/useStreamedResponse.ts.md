Summary:
This file exports a custom React hook called `useStreamedResponse` that generates a response from an AI model by making a POST request to an API endpoint. The response is streamed back in chunks and parsed to extract the answer and any additional data. The hook returns the loading state, the generated response, and a function to generate the response.

Import statements:
- `useEffect` and `useState` from the `react` library.

Script Summary:
The script exports a custom React hook called `useStreamedResponse` that takes an object with two properties, `answers` and `addAnswer`. It initializes two state variables, `isLoading` and `generatedResponse`, using the `useState` hook. The `generateResponse` function is defined to make a POST request to an API endpoint with a prompt, answers, and filters. The response is streamed back in chunks and parsed to extract the answer and any additional data. The `isLoading` state variable is set to `true` while the request is being made and set to `false` when the response is received. The `generatedResponse` state variable is updated with the answer and any additional data as it is received. Finally, the `addAnswer` function is called with the answer and any additional data.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the API endpoint specified in the `fetch` call to generate a response from an AI model. It also interacts with the `answers` and `addAnswer` properties passed in as arguments to the `useStreamedResponse` hook.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the `answers` and `addAnswer` properties passed in as arguments to the `useStreamedResponse` hook?
- What is the format of the response returned by the API endpoint?
- How can I modify the `generateResponse` function to handle errors returned by the API endpoint?
