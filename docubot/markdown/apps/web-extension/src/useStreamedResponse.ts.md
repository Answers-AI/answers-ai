Summary:
This file contains a custom React hook called useStreamedResponse that handles the generation of responses from an API endpoint that streams data. It uses the useState hook to manage loading state and the generated response.

Import statements:
The file imports the useState hook from the React library.

Script Summary:
The useStreamedResponse hook takes in an object with answers and addAnswer properties. It then defines a generateResponse function that sends a POST request to an API endpoint and streams the response data. As the data is streamed, it is decoded and parsed into JSON objects. The generated response is then updated with the new data and the loading state is set to false.
