Purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application:

A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that define how an application should behave or operate. It is used to store configuration data that is required by the application to function properly. The configuration file can be used to set up various parameters such as database connection strings, API keys, environment variables, and other settings that are specific to the application.
