This file contains the configuration for Vite, a build tool for modern web applications. It imports the `react` plugin and the `crx` plugin, which is used to generate a Chrome extension.

The `manifest.json` file contains the configuration for the Chrome extension, including its name, version, and permissions. It also specifies the content script to be used.

The `vite_config_default` variable is defined using `defineConfig` and includes the imported plugins. It is exported as the default configuration for Vite.
