Summary:
This is a configuration file for a Node.js application called "answers-ai". It includes settings for workspaces, scripts, dependencies, and engines.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a custom application for an AI-powered question answering system.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets up various scripts for running the application in development and production environments, as well as dependencies and engines required for the application to run.

Configuration Breakdown:
- name: The name of the application.
- version: The version of the application.
- private: A boolean indicating whether the application is private or not.
- workspaces: An array of directories that contain packages that should be treated as workspaces.
- scripts: An object containing various scripts for running the application, including "dev", "build", "db", "start", "logs", "lint", "format", and "docubot".
- devDependencies: An object containing development dependencies required for the application to run, including "dotenv-cli", "eslint-config-custom", "inngest-cli", "prettier", "prisma", and "turbo".
- engines: An object specifying the minimum version of Node.js required for the application to run.
- packageManager: The package manager used for the application, in this case "pnpm".
- dependencies: An object containing dependencies required for the application to run, including "docubot" and "wait-on".

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file sets up the necessary dependencies and scripts for the application to run in various environments. It may interact with other components of the application, such as database migrations and API endpoints.

Developer Questions:
- What are the specific settings for each script in the "scripts" object?
- What is the purpose of each dependency listed in the "devDependencies" and "dependencies" objects?
- How does the "workspaces" setting affect the application's package management?
- What is the purpose of the "engines" setting, and what happens if the minimum version of Node.js is not met?
