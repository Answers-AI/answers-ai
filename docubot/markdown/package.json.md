What is the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application?
A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that define the behavior of a larger application. It is used to customize the application's behavior to suit specific needs and requirements. Configuration files are typically used to store settings related to database connections, API keys, logging, and other application-specific settings.

File Contents:
The provided file is a configuration file for a Node.js application. It contains settings related to the application's name, version, workspaces, scripts, dependencies, engines, and package manager.

Summary:
This file is a configuration file for a Node.js application. It contains settings related to the application's name, version, workspaces, scripts, dependencies, engines, and package manager.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not explicitly stated in the file. However, based on the contents of the file, it appears to be a backend service that uses Node.js and Prisma for database management.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file is used to customize the behavior of the Node.js application. It contains settings related to the application's name, version, workspaces, scripts, dependencies, engines, and package manager.

Configuration Breakdown:
- name: The name of the application.
- version: The version of the application.
- private: A boolean value that indicates whether the application is private or not.
- workspaces: An array of workspace paths.
- scripts: An object that contains scripts that can be run using the "npm run" command.
- devDependencies: An object that contains development dependencies.
- engines: An object that specifies the version of Node.js that the application requires.
- packageManager: The package manager that the application uses.
- dependencies: An object that contains dependencies.

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file interacts with the rest of the application by customizing its behavior. For example, the "scripts" section contains scripts that can be run using the "npm run" command, which allows developers to run specific tasks such as building the application or running tests.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of each script in the "scripts" section?
- What is the purpose of each dependency in the "dependencies" section?
- What is the purpose of each development dependency in the "devDependencies" section?
- How does the "workspaces" section affect the behavior of the application?
- What is the purpose of the "engines" section?
- How does the "packageManager" section affect the behavior of the application?
