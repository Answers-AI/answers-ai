Summary:
This file defines a React context and provider for managing the state and interactions related to the AI chat application. It handles the communication with the API, manages the chat messages, and provides utility functions for updating and deleting chats, prompts, and journeys.

Import statements:
- `axios` for making API requests.
- `useRouter` from `next/navigation` for handling navigation and refreshing the page.
- Various hooks and types from `react` and the application's custom types.
- `deepmerge` utility function for merging filter objects.
- `useStreamedResponse` custom hook for handling streamed responses.

Component:
- `AnswersContext`: A React context for managing the state and interactions related to the AI chat application.
- `AnswersProvider`: A React provider component that wraps the application and provides the context values.

Hooks:
- `useState`: For managing the state of error, inputValue, isLoading, messages, filters, showFilters, and useStreaming.
- `useCallback`: For memoizing the addMessage function.
- `useRef`: For keeping track of the current message index.
- `useStreamedResponse`: A custom hook for handling streamed responses.

Event Handlers:
- `sendMessage`: Sends a message to the API and updates the chat messages state.
- `regenerateAnswer`: Regenerates an answer by resending the last user message.
- `clearMessages`: Clears the messages state and navigates to the home page.
- `updateFilter`: Updates the filters state by merging the new filter with the existing filters.

Rendered components:
- `AnswersContext.Provider`: Wraps the children components and provides the context values.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the context and utility functions for managing the chat application state and API communication. It is used by other components to send messages, update filters, and manage the chat, prompt, and journey data.

Developer Questions:
- How does the `useStreamedResponse` hook work and how does it handle the streamed responses?
- How are the filters merged and updated in the `updateFilter` function?
- How does the component handle errors and loading states?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- Error handling could be improved by providing more detailed error messages and handling different types of errors.
- The component could be refactored to use a reducer for managing the state, which would make it easier to handle complex state updates.
- The code could be further documented to provide more information about the custom hooks and utility functions.
