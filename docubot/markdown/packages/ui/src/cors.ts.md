Summary:
This file exports a middleware function that initializes the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware for the Next.js application. It also includes a helper function to wait for a middleware to execute before continuing and to throw an error when an error happens in a middleware.

Import statements:
- Cors: a third-party middleware package for handling CORS
- NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse: interfaces from the Next.js framework for handling HTTP requests and responses

Script Summary:
The script exports a middleware function that initializes the CORS middleware with the options to only allow requests with GET, POST, and OPTIONS methods.

Internal Functions:
- initMiddleware: a helper function that takes a middleware function as a parameter and returns a new function that waits for the middleware to execute before continuing. It also throws an error if an error happens in the middleware. It takes in the Next.js request and response objects and returns a Promise that resolves with the middleware result.

External Functions:
- default: exports the initialized CORS middleware function.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used as a middleware for the Next.js application to handle CORS. It can be used in any API routes that require CORS handling.

Developer Questions:
- What other middleware functions are being used in the application?
- How are the API routes being defined and used in the application?
- What are the available options for the Cors middleware and how can they be customized for the application's needs?
