Summary:
This file imports the Cors middleware and NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse types from the Next.js framework. It exports a function that initializes the Cors middleware with specific options and returns a promise that resolves when the middleware is executed.

Import statements:
- Cors: a middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for HTTP requests
- NextApiRequest: a type that represents the incoming HTTP request in a Next.js API route
- NextApiResponse: a type that represents the outgoing HTTP response in a Next.js API route

Script Summary:
This script exports a function that initializes the Cors middleware with specific options and returns a promise that resolves when the middleware is executed.

Internal Functions:
- initMiddleware: a helper function that returns a function that wraps a middleware function and returns a promise that resolves when the middleware is executed. It takes a middleware function as a parameter and returns a function that takes a NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse as parameters. The returned function executes the middleware function with the request and response objects and returns a promise that resolves with the result of the middleware function.

External Functions:
- default: a function that initializes the Cors middleware with specific options and returns a promise that resolves when the middleware is executed. It uses the initMiddleware helper function to wrap the Cors middleware function and returns the wrapped middleware function.

Interaction Summary:
This file exports a middleware function that can be used in a Next.js API route to enable CORS for HTTP requests. It can be imported and used in any API route that requires CORS.

Developer Questions:
- What are the available options for the Cors middleware?
- How do I use this middleware in a Next.js API route?
- How do I test the functionality of this middleware?

Known Issues and TODOs:
There are no known issues or bugs with this component. However, a TODO item could be to add more options for the Cors middleware to provide more flexibility for API routes that require CORS.
