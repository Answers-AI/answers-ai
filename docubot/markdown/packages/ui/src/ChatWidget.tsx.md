Component:
ChatWidget is a functional component that takes in two props: session and params. It uses the useState hook to manage the isAuthorized state, which is initially set to true if the session has a user. It then uses the useEffect hook to check if the user is authorized, and if not, it retrieves the apiKey from the URL search params and uses the signIn function to authenticate the user. If authentication is successful, it sets isAuthorized to true and refreshes the page. Finally, it renders the ChatDetailWidget component if the user is authorized and has a session.

Hooks:
- useState: manages the isAuthorized state
- useEffect: checks if the user is authorized and authenticates the user if not
