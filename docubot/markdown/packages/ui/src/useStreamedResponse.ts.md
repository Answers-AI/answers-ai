Summary:
This file contains a custom React hook called useStreamedResponse that is used to generate a response from an API endpoint and stream the response back to the client in chunks. The hook takes in various parameters such as the chatId, journeyId, messages, filters, apiUrl, onChunk, and onEnd. It returns an object with isLoading, generatedResponse, and generateResponse properties.

Import statements:
The file imports the useState hook from the React library and the Message type from a types file.

Script Summary:
The useStreamedResponse hook generates a response from an API endpoint and streams the response back to the client in chunks. It takes in various parameters such as the chatId, journeyId, messages, filters, apiUrl, onChunk, and onEnd. It returns an object with isLoading, generatedResponse, and generateResponse properties.

Internal Functions:
- generateResponse: This function takes in a prompt string and generates a response from an API endpoint. It sets the generatedResponse state to an empty object, sets the isStreaming state to true, and makes a POST request to the API endpoint with the given parameters. It then reads the response in chunks and calls the onChunk function with each chunk until the response is fully streamed. Finally, it sets the generatedResponse state to an empty object, sets the isStreaming state to false, and calls the onEnd function.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
