Interaction Summary:
This component is a client-side component that interacts with the rest of the application by allowing users to navigate to different chat pages and create new journeys. It also stores the open state of the drawer in local storage.

Developer Questions:
- How are journeys and chats fetched and passed to this component?
- How does the creation of a new journey work in the larger application?
- Are there any additional actions that should be handled when a user interacts with the drawer?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- The `handleNewJourney` function is currently empty and needs to be implemented.
- The component may need additional error handling or loading states for fetching journeys and chats.
