Summary:
This file contains a React component called JiraSettings that displays a form allowing users to select which Jira projects are enabled and set default filters for those projects. The component is a client-side component.

Import statements:
The file imports several Material UI components, as well as two custom hooks (useAppSettings and AutocompleteSelect) and two types (AnswersFilters and AppSettings).

Component:
The JiraSettings component takes in two props: appSettings, which is an object containing the current app settings, and editable, which is a boolean indicating whether the form is editable or read-only. The component displays a form with checkboxes for each Jira project, a button to select/deselect all projects, and two AutocompleteSelect components for setting default filters. If editable is true, the component also displays buttons to save or discard changes.

Hooks:
The component uses the useAppSettings hook to fetch and update app settings. It also uses the useState hook to manage local state for filters and localSettings.

Event Handlers:
The component has several event handlers:
- handleSave: updates app settings with the localSettings and filters state
- handleEnableProject: toggles the enabled property of a Jira project
- handleToggleAll: toggles the enabled property of all Jira projects

Rendered components:
The component renders several Material UI components, including Box, FormControl, FormLabel, FormGroup, FormControlLabel, Checkbox, Button, Typography, Paper, and LinearProgress. It also renders two AutocompleteSelect components.

Interaction Summary:
The JiraSettings component interacts with the useAppSettings hook to fetch and update app settings. It also interacts with the AutocompleteSelect components to set default filters.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if the appSettings prop is null or undefined?
- How does the useAppSettings hook work?
- What happens if the handleSave function fails to update app settings?
