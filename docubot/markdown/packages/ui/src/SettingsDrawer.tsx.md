Component:

Hooks:
- `useState` is used to manage the `open` state of the drawer.

Interaction Summary:
The `SettingsDrawer` component interacts with the rest of the application through navigation. When a user clicks on a settings option, the component navigates to the corresponding page.

Developer Questions:
- How do the `settings` and `chats` props get populated?
- Are there any additional settings options that need to be added to the `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` array?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- Some commented-out code related to additional settings options needs to be reviewed and either implemented or removed.
- The component does not currently handle any user interactions, such as opening or closing the drawer. This functionality may need to be added in the future.
