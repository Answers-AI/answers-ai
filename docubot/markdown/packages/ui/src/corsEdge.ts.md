Summary:
This file contains a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) library that allows for cross-origin requests in web applications. It includes functions for determining if an origin is allowed, getting origin headers from a request, and handling preflight requests. The library can be used in conjunction with other web APIs to enable cross-origin requests.

Import statements:
None.

Script Summary:
This script defines a CORS library that can be used in web applications to enable cross-origin requests. It includes functions for determining if an origin is allowed, getting origin headers from a request, and handling preflight requests.

Internal Functions:
- isOriginAllowed: Determines if a given origin is allowed based on a static origin or an array of static origins or regular expressions.
  - Parameters: origin (string), allowed (StaticOrigin)
  - Returns: boolean
- getOriginHeaders: Returns a Headers object with the appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin header based on the request origin and the allowed origin(s).
  - Parameters: reqOrigin (string), origin (StaticOrigin)
  - Returns: Headers
- originHeadersFromReq: Returns a Promise that resolves to a Headers object with the appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin header based on the request origin and the allowed origin(s).
  - Parameters: req (Request), origin (StaticOrigin | OriginFn)
  - Returns: Promise&lt;Headers&gt;
- getAllowedHeaders: Returns a Headers object with the appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Headers header based on the request headers and the allowed headers.
  - Parameters: req (Request), allowed (string | string[])
  - Returns: Headers

External Functions:
- cors: Handles CORS for a given request and response object based on the provided options.
  - Parameters: req (Request), res (Response), options (CorsOptions)
  - Returns: Promise&lt;Response&gt;
- initCors: Returns a function that handles CORS for a given request and response object based on the provided options.
  - Parameters: options (CorsOptions)
  - Returns: (req: Request, res: Response) =&gt; Promise&lt;Response&gt;

Interaction Summary:
This file can be used in web applications to enable cross-origin requests. It can be imported and used in conjunction with other web APIs to handle CORS for incoming requests.

Developer Questions:
- What are the possible values for StaticOrigin?
- How does the isOriginAllowed function determine if an origin is allowed?
- What is the purpose of the preflightContinue option in the CorsOptions?
- How does the getAllowedHeaders function determine the allowed headers for a request?

Known Issues and TODOs:
None.
