Summary:
This file contains a function called `extractFilters` that takes in a prompt and filters object as parameters. It uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to the prompt and extracts a JSON object from the response that matches a specific format. It returns the extracted filters object.

Import statements:
The file imports two modules:
- `AnswersFilters` from `types`: This is a custom type that defines the structure of the filters object.
- `openai` from `@utils/openai/client`: This is a module that provides a client for the OpenAI API.

Script Summary:
The `extractFilters` function takes in a prompt and filters object as parameters. It uses the `openai` client to generate a response to the prompt using the `createCompletion` method. It then extracts a JSON object from the response that matches the format specified in the prompt. The extracted object is returned.

Internal Functions:
The `extractFilters` function is the only function in this file.

External Functions:
This file does not export any functions.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API through the `openai` client to generate a response to the prompt. It also interacts with the `AnswersFilters` type to define the structure of the filters object.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the prompt parameter?
- What is the expected format of the filters object?
- What happens if the OpenAI API response does not contain a valid JSON object?
- What happens if the `createCompletion` method fails?
