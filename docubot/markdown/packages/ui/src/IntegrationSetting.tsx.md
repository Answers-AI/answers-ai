Summary:
IntegrationSetting.tsx is a React component that renders different settings components based on the app passed as a prop. It imports JiraSettings, SlackSettings, and ConfluenceSettings components and stores them in a SETTINGS object.

If not, a message is displayed indicating that support for that integration is not yet available.
