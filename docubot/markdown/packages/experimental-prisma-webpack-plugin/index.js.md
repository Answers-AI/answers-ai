Summary:
This file exports a Webpack plugin called PrismaPlugin, which copies Prisma files (schema and engine) to the output directory of a Webpack build. It also updates nft.json files to include the copied Prisma files. 

Import statements:
This file imports the path and fs/promises modules from Node.js.

Script Summary:
This file exports a Webpack plugin called PrismaPlugin, which copies Prisma files (schema and engine) to the output directory of a Webpack build. It also updates nft.json files to include the copied Prisma files. 

Internal Functions:
- getPrismaDir(from): This function takes a directory path as input and returns the path to the directory containing the Prisma schema file. It checks if the schema.prisma file exists in the input directory, and if not, it finds the generated Prisma client and returns the directory containing it.
- getPrismaFiles(from): This function takes a directory path as input and returns an array of Prisma files (schema and engine) in that directory. It uses the getPrismaDir function to get the directory containing the Prisma schema file, and then reads the directory to find all Prisma files.
- apply(compiler): This function is called when the plugin is applied to a Webpack compiler. It hooks into the compilation process and performs the following steps:
  - Reads the Webpack assets to find all JavaScript files.
  - For each JavaScript file, it finds all occurrences of the Prisma output directory using a regular expression, and uses the getPrismaDir and getPrismaFiles functions to get the Prisma files in that directory.
  - It updates the JavaScript file to replace all occurrences of "schema.prisma" with the actual file name, and renames any duplicate schema.prisma files to schema.prisma1, schema.prisma2, etc.
  - It updates a map of source and destination paths for each Prisma file.
  - Reads the Webpack assets again to find all nft.json files.
  - For each nft.json file, it updates the "files" array to include the paths of the Prisma files.
  - After the Webpack build is done, it copies all Prisma files to their respective output directories.

External Functions:
- PrismaPlugin(options): This is the constructor for the PrismaPlugin class. It takes an optional options object as input.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Webpack compiler and the output directory of a Webpack build. It also interacts with nft.json files, which are used by the Vercel platform.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the options object for the PrismaPlugin constructor?
- How does the regular expression for finding the Prisma output directory work?
- What happens if there are multiple Prisma output directories in a JavaScript file?
- How does the plugin handle errors when copying files?
- How does the plugin handle changes to Prisma files during watch mode?
