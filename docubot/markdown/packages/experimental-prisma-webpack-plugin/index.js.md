Summary:
This file contains the implementation of the PrismaPlugin class, which is a Webpack plugin that copies Prisma files (schema and engine) to the output directory of a Webpack build. It also updates nft.json files to include the Prisma files and renames schema.prisma files if there are multiple ones.

Import statements:
- path: a Node.js module for working with file paths
- fs/promises: a Node.js module for working with the file system

Script Summary:
- Defines a regular expression to match the output path of a Prisma client in a JavaScript file
- Defines a function to get the directory of a Prisma client from a given path
- Defines a function to get all Prisma files (schema and engine) from a given path
- Defines the PrismaPlugin class with a constructor and an apply method
- The apply method registers hooks to process assets during compilation and after compilation is done
- During compilation, the plugin reads JavaScript files to find the output path of Prisma clients and copies the Prisma files to the output directory
- After compilation, the plugin updates nft.json files to include the Prisma files

Internal Functions:
- getPrismaDir(from): returns the directory of a Prisma client from a given path
  - Parameters:
    - from: a string representing the path to search for the Prisma client
  - Returns: a string representing the directory of the Prisma client
- getPrismaFiles(from): returns an array of Prisma files (schema and engine) from a given path
  - Parameters:
    - from: a string representing the path to search for the Prisma files
  - Returns: an array of strings representing the Prisma files
- apply(compiler): applies the plugin to a Webpack compiler instance
  - Parameters:
    - compiler: a Webpack compiler instance
  - Returns: nothing

External Functions:
- PrismaPlugin(options): a constructor for the PrismaPlugin class
  - Parameters:
    - options: an object representing the options for the plugin
  - Returns: an instance of the PrismaPlugin class

Interaction Summary:
The PrismaPlugin class is a Webpack plugin that interacts with the compilation process of a Webpack build. It reads JavaScript files to find the output path of Prisma clients and copies the Prisma files to the output directory. It also updates nft.json files to include the Prisma files. This plugin could potentially interact with other Webpack plugins or loaders that modify the output of a Webpack build.

Developer Questions:
- What are the options for the PrismaPlugin constructor?
- How does the plugin handle multiple schema.prisma files?
- What happens if a Prisma file already exists in the output directory?
- How does the plugin handle errors during file copying?
- What other Webpack plugins or loaders could potentially conflict with this plugin?
