Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that creates a new table called "Answer" and adds a foreign key constraint to the "promptId" column referencing the "id" column of the "Prompt" table.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL commands.

Code Summary:
The file contains two SQL commands. The first command creates a new table called "Answer" with three columns: "id" (a serial integer), "promptId" (an integer), and "text" (a text field). The second command adds a foreign key constraint to the "promptId" column referencing the "id" column of the "Prompt" table.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses the Prisma ORM to manage the database. When the application starts up, Prisma will check if any new migrations need to be applied and execute them if necessary. This file will create a new table and add a foreign key constraint to an existing table, which will allow the application to store and retrieve answers to prompts.

Developer Questions:
- What other tables in the database does this file interact with?
- What happens if the "Prompt" table is deleted or modified?
- How can I test that the migration was successful?
- What happens if I modify the SQL commands in this file?
