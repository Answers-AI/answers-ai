Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that adds two columns, "ok" and "state", to the "Account" table in the database.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL commands.

Code Summary:
The code consists of a single SQL command that alters the "Account" table by adding two columns, "ok" and "state".

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the database through the Prisma ORM. When the application starts up, Prisma will check if any migrations need to be executed and will run this script if necessary. Once the migration is complete, the "Account" table in the database will have two new columns, "ok" and "state", which can be accessed and modified by other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "ok" and "state" columns?
- Will any other parts of the application need to be updated to use these new columns?
- What happens if this migration fails to execute? How can we troubleshoot the issue?
- Are there any other migrations that depend on this one?
