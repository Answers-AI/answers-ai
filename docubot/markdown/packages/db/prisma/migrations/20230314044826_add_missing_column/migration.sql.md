Code Summary:
The code in this file is a single SQL command that alters the "Account" table in the database by adding a new column called "refresh_token_expires_in" of type INTEGER.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses the Prisma ORM for database management. When this file is executed as part of a database migration, it will add a new column to the "Account" table in the database. This new column can then be used by other parts of the application to store and retrieve data.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application rely on the "Account" table?
- Are there any other database migrations that depend on this one?
- What happens if this migration fails to execute properly?
- How can we test that this migration has been successful?
