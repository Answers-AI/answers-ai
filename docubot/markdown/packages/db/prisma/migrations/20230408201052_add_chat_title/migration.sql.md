Code Summary:
The code in this file is a single SQL command that alters the "Chat" table in the database by adding a new column "title" of type TEXT.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of the Prisma ORM's migration system, which allows developers to manage changes to the database schema over time. When this migration is run, the "Chat" table in the database will be altered to include the new "title" column. This could potentially impact any parts of the application that interact with the "Chat" table, such as chat message rendering or database queries.

Developer Questions:

- Are there any existing queries or mutations that need to be updated to include the new "title" column?
- What happens if this migration is run multiple times? Will it cause any issues or errors?
