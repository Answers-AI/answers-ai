Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that adds a new column to the "User" table and creates a new "Organization" table with several columns. It also adds a foreign key constraint to the "User" table that references the "id" column of the "Organization" table.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM and a SQL database.

Code Summary:
The code consists of three SQL statements:
1. ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN "organizationId" TEXT, ADD COLUMN "role" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user';
This statement adds two new columns to the "User" table: "organizationId" and "role". The "organizationId" column is of type TEXT and will be used to store the ID of the organization that the user belongs to. The "role" column is also of type TEXT and has a default value of 'user', indicating that all users initially have the role of a regular user.

2. CREATE TABLE "Organization" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT,
    "image" TEXT,
    "appSettings" JSONB,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    CONSTRAINT "Organization_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
This statement creates a new table called "Organization" with several columns: "id", "name", "image", "appSettings", "createdAt", and "updatedAt". The "id" column is of type TEXT and is set as the primary key for the table. The "name" and "image" columns are of type TEXT and will be used to store the name and image of the organization, respectively. The "appSettings" column is of type JSONB and will be used to store any additional settings for the organization. The "createdAt" and "updatedAt" columns are of type TIMESTAMP(3) and are set to the current timestamp by default.

3. ALTER TABLE "User" ADD CONSTRAINT "User_organizationId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("organizationId") REFERENCES "Organization"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;
This statement adds a foreign key constraint to the "User" table that references the "id" column of the "Organization" table. This means that the "organizationId" column in the "User" table can only contain values that exist in the "id" column of the "Organization" table. The "ON DELETE SET NULL" and "ON UPDATE CASCADE" clauses specify what should happen when an organization is deleted or updated. If an organization is deleted, the "organizationId" column in the "User" table will be set to NULL. If an organization's ID is updated, the "organizationId" column in the "User" table will be updated to reflect the new ID.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that likely uses the Prisma ORM to interact with a SQL database. The changes made by this migration script will affect how the "User" and "Organization" tables are structured and how they relate to each other. Developers working on other parts of the application may need to be aware of these changes and update their code accordingly.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application depend on the "User" and "Organization" tables?
- How will existing data in the "User" table be affected by the addition of the "organizationId" and "role" columns?
- How will the "appSettings" column in the "Organization" table be used?
- Are there any other foreign key constraints that reference the "id" column of the "Organization" table?
- What happens if an organization is deleted or updated while it still has users associated with it?
