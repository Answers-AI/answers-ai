Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that drops a column from the "Prompt" table, creates a new table "_PromptToUser", and adds foreign key constraints to the new table. 

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The script begins by dropping a foreign key constraint on the "Prompt" table. It then drops the "userId" column from the "Prompt" table. Next, it creates a new table "_PromptToUser" with two columns, "A" and "B". It creates two indexes on the new table, one unique index on columns "A" and "B", and one non-unique index on column "B". Finally, it adds two foreign key constraints to the new table, one referencing the "Prompt" table and one referencing the "User" table.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Prisma ORM to manage the database schema. It modifies the schema by dropping a column and creating a new table with foreign key constraints. Other parts of the application that use the "Prompt" and "User" tables may be affected by these schema changes.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "_PromptToUser" table?
- How will dropping the "userId" column affect other parts of the application?
- Are there any other parts of the application that depend on the foreign key constraint that is being dropped?
- What happens if the migration script fails partway through execution?
