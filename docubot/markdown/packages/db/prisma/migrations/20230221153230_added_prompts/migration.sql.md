Summary:
This file contains SQL code for creating a new table called "Prompt" and adding a foreign key constraint to it.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The SQL code in this file creates a new table called "Prompt" with columns for id, userId, title, description, likes, and prompt. The id column is set to auto-increment using the SERIAL keyword. The userId column is a foreign key that references the id column of the "User" table. The foreign key constraint is added using the ADD CONSTRAINT statement.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses the Prisma ORM for database management. The "Prompt" table created in this file can be used to store prompts for a writing app. The foreign key constraint ensures that each prompt is associated with a specific user.

Developer Questions:
- What other tables in the database are related to the "Prompt" table?
- How are prompts added to the "Prompt" table?
- What happens if a user is deleted from the "User" table?
