Summary:
This file contains SQL code for a database migration that adds a new column to the "Chat" table and creates two new tables ("Journey" and "_JourneyToUser") with various constraints and indexes.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The code in this file adds a new column called "journeyId" to the "Chat" table. It then creates a new table called "Journey" with columns for "id", "title", "filters", "createdAt", and "updatedAt". The "id" column is set as the primary key. It also creates a new table called "_JourneyToUser" with columns for "A" and "B". Two unique indexes are created for this table. Finally, foreign key constraints are added to the "Chat" and "_JourneyToUser" tables to reference the "Journey" and "User" tables, respectively.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses a database to store chat messages and user information. The migration defined in this file adds a new feature to the application by introducing the concept of "journeys". This allows users to group their chats based on a specific topic or theme. The new "journeyId" column in the "Chat" table allows chats to be associated with a specific journey. The "Journey" and "_JourneyToUser" tables allow for the creation and management of journeys and their associated users.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application depend on the "Chat" table and how will they be affected by the addition of the "journeyId" column?
- How will the "Journey" and "_JourneyToUser" tables be populated with data?
- What happens if a user is deleted from the "User" table but still has a reference in the "_JourneyToUser" table?
- How can we modify the foreign key constraints if we need to change the relationships between tables?
