Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that alters the "Chat" table in the database by making the "promptId" column optional. It drops the foreign key constraint on "Chat_promptId_fkey", alters the "promptId" column to drop the NOT NULL constraint, and then adds a new foreign key constraint on "Chat_promptId_fkey" that references the "id" column in the "Prompt" table with ON DELETE SET NULL and ON UPDATE CASCADE options.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL migration script on the database.

Code Summary:
The SQL migration script consists of three SQL statements that perform the following actions:
1. DropForeignKey: Drops the foreign key constraint on "Chat_promptId_fkey".
2. AlterTable: Alters the "promptId" column in the "Chat" table to drop the NOT NULL constraint.
3. AddForeignKey: Adds a new foreign key constraint on "Chat_promptId_fkey" that references the "id" column in the "Prompt" table with ON DELETE SET NULL and ON UPDATE CASCADE options.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the database by altering the "Chat" table to make the "promptId" column optional. This change could potentially affect other parts of the application that rely on the "Chat" table and its relationship with the "Prompt" table. For example, if there are any queries or mutations that depend on the "promptId" column being present in the "Chat" table, they may need to be updated to handle the case where "promptId" is null.

Developer Questions:
1. What other parts of the application depend on the "Chat" table and its relationship with the "Prompt" table?
2. Are there any queries or mutations that need to be updated to handle the case where "promptId" is null?
3. What are the implications of making the "promptId" column optional?
