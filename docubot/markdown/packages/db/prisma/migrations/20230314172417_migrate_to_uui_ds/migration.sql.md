# README for SQL Script

## TODO Items
- None

## Known Issues
- The primary key for the tables mentioned in the warnings section will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.

## Description
This SQL script contains a series of ALTER TABLE statements that modify the schema of the database. The script drops foreign key constraints, alters columns, and adds new foreign key constraints. The warnings section highlights the potential risks associated with running this script, specifically with regards to changing the primary key of certain tables. 

## Usage
This script should be run on a PostgreSQL database. It is recommended to backup the database before running this script.
