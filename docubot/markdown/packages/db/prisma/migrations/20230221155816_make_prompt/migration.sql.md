Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that adds two new columns to the "Prompt" table in the database and creates a unique index on the "prompt" column. The script includes warnings about potential issues with existing data in the table.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for interacting with the database.

Code Summary:
The script begins with a comment containing warnings about potential issues with adding the new columns and unique index. It then uses the "ALTER TABLE" command to add the "dislikes" and "usages" columns to the "Prompt" table with the "INTEGER" data type and "NOT NULL" constraint. Finally, it uses the "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX" command to create a unique index on the "prompt" column of the "Prompt" table.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses the Prisma ORM to interact with the database. The changes made by this migration script will affect the "Prompt" table in the database, which may impact other parts of the application that rely on this table. For example, if there are existing queries that reference the "Prompt" table but do not include the new "dislikes" and "usages" columns, those queries may need to be updated.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application rely on the "Prompt" table?
- Are there any existing queries that need to be updated to include the new "dislikes" and "usages" columns?
- How will existing data in the "Prompt" table be affected by the addition of the new columns and unique index?
- Are there any other potential issues with this migration that need to be addressed?
