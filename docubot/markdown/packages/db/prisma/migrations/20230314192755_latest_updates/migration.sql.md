Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that adds a new column called "filters" to the "Chat" table in the database. It also includes a warning about adding a required column without a default value.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL migration.

Code Summary:
The code consists of a single SQL command that alters the "Chat" table by adding a new column called "filters" with a JSONB data type and a NOT NULL constraint.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the database through the Prisma ORM. When the application is started, Prisma will check if there are any pending migrations and execute them in order to update the database schema. This file will be executed as part of that process, adding the new "filters" column to the "Chat" table.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "filters" column in the "Chat" table?
- What happens if the "Chat" table is not empty when this migration is executed?
- Are there any other parts of the application that rely on the "Chat" table and could be affected by this migration?
