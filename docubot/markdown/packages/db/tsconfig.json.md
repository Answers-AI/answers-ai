What is the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application?
A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that define how a larger application should behave. It is used to customize the behavior of the application without having to modify the code. Configuration files can be used to set up things like database connections, logging, security settings, and other application-specific settings.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file specifies the compiler options, file inclusion and exclusion rules, and the types that should be included in the project.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "compilerOptions": This section specifies the compiler options for the TypeScript compiler. The "outDir" option specifies the output directory for compiled files. The "rootDir" option specifies the root directory of the TypeScript source files. The "allowJs" option allows JavaScript files to be included in the project. The "isolatedModules" option ensures that each file is compiled in isolation.
- "exclude": This section specifies the files and directories that should be excluded from the project.
- "extends": This section specifies the base configuration file that this configuration file extends.
- "include": This section specifies the files and directories that should be included in the project.
- "types": This section specifies the types that should be included in the project.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler to specify how the TypeScript code should be compiled.

Developer Questions:
- What are the default compiler options for TypeScript?
- How do I add a new type to the project?
- How do I exclude a file or directory from the project?
- How do I change the output directory for compiled files?
