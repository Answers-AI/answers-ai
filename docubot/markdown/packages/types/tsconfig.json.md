What is the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application?
A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that define how a larger application should behave. It is used to customize the behavior of the application without changing the code. Configuration files are often used to store settings that are specific to a particular environment or deployment, such as development, testing, or production.

File Contents:
The provided file is a TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) that is used to configure the TypeScript compiler. It contains several settings that define how TypeScript should compile the code.

Summary:
The tsconfig.json file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler.

Service:
N/A

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file specifies the following settings:
- "compilerOptions": This section contains settings that configure the TypeScript compiler, such as the target version of JavaScript to compile to, the module system to use, and the output directory for compiled files.
- "exclude": This setting specifies files or directories that should be excluded from compilation.
- "extends": This setting specifies a base configuration file that this configuration file should inherit from.
- "include": This setting specifies files or directories that should be included in compilation.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "compilerOptions":
  - "lib": Specifies the library files to include when compiling the code. In this case, it includes the ES2015 library.
  - "module": Specifies the module system to use when compiling the code. In this case, it uses CommonJS.
  - "outDir": Specifies the output directory for compiled files. In this case, it is set to "./dist".
  - "rootDir": Specifies the root directory for the source files. In this case, it is set to "./src".
  - "sourceMap": Specifies whether to generate source maps for compiled files. In this case, it is set to true.
- "exclude": Specifies files or directories that should be excluded from compilation. In this case, it excludes the "node_modules" directory.
- "extends": Specifies a base configuration file that this configuration file should inherit from. In this case, it inherits from "tsconfig/base.json".
- "include": Specifies files or directories that should be included in compilation. In this case, it includes the "src" directory.

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file is used by the TypeScript compiler to determine how to compile the code. It can affect the output of the compiler, such as the generated JavaScript code and source maps.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of this configuration file?
- What are the different settings in the configuration file and what do they do?
- How does changing a setting in the configuration file affect the compiled output?
- How does this configuration file interact with other parts of the application, such as build scripts or deployment processes?
