Summary:
This file contains code related to language models and chains used in the larger application. It imports various dependencies and exports functions related to creating chat chains, summarization chains, and raw chains.

Import statements:
- LLMChain: A class for creating language model chains
- ChatOpenAI: A class for creating chat-based language models
- OpenAI: A class for creating language models
- ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate: Classes for creating prompts for chat-based language models
- Message: A type for representing chat messages
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: A class for splitting text into characters recursively
- Configuration, OpenAIApi: Classes for interacting with the OpenAI API
- assistantPrompt, chatPrompt, intentionPrompt, rawPrompt, summarizeQAPrompt, summarizePrompt: Templates for prompts used in language models

Script Summary:
This file exports functions for creating chat chains, summarization chains, and raw chains. It also initializes an OpenAI API instance and creates instances of the ChatOpenAI and OpenAI classes.

Internal Functions:
- initializeOpenAI: Initializes an OpenAI API instance with an API key from an environment variable and returns it.

External Functions:
- createChatChain: Takes an array of chat messages and returns a chat chain object with a call function that takes context, userName, input, and history parameters and returns a completionRequest and text.
- summarizeChain: A summarization chain created using the summarizePrompt template and the OpenAI class.
- summarizeQAChain: A summarization chain created using the summarizeQAPrompt template and the ChatOpenAI class.
- rawChain: A raw chain created using the rawPrompt template and the ChatOpenAI class.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API to create language models. It also interacts with other files in the utils package to import templates for prompts.

Developer Questions:
- How are the chat messages passed to the createChatChain function?
- What is the purpose of the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class?
- How are the various prompts used in the language models?
- What is the purpose of the summarizeQAChain and how is it different from the other chains?
- How can I modify the temperature parameter for the language models?
