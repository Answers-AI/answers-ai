Summary:
This file initializes and exports several chains for language processing using OpenAI's API. It also exports a function for initializing the API and a function for creating a chat chain.

Import statements:
The file imports several modules from the 'langchain' and 'openai' packages, as well as several custom modules from the same directory. It also imports a 'Message' type from a 'types' module.

Script Summary:
The file initializes and exports several chains for language processing using OpenAI's API. It also exports a function for initializing the API and a function for creating a chat chain.

Internal Functions:
- initializeOpenAI(): This function initializes the OpenAI API using an API key and returns an instance of the OpenAIApi class.

External Functions:
- createChatChain({ messages }): This function creates a chat chain using the ChatOpenAI class from the 'langchain' package. It takes an optional 'messages' parameter, which is an array of Message objects. It returns an object with a 'call' method that takes several parameters and returns a completion request and text response.
- summarizeChain: This is an instance of the LLMChain class from the 'langchain' package. It is initialized with a prompt and an instance of the OpenAI class.
- summarizeQAChain: This is an instance of the LLMChain class from the 'langchain' package. It is initialized with a prompt and an instance of the ChatOpenAI class.
- rawChain: This is an instance of the LLMChain class from the 'langchain' package. It is initialized with a prompt and an instance of the ChatOpenAI class.

Interaction Summary:
This file exports several functions and instances of classes that can be used for language processing using OpenAI's API. These functions and classes can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the 'messages' parameter in the createChatChain function?
- What is the difference between the summarizeChain and summarizeQAChain instances?
- What is the purpose of the rawChain instance?
