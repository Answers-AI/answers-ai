Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger chatbot application. The `getCompletionRequest` function could be called by other functions in the application to generate a chat completion request. The returned object could be used to generate a response to a user's input.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the `max_tokens` parameter?
- What is the purpose of the `temperature` parameter?
- What other models can be used for the `model` parameter?
- How is the `history` parameter used in the chat completion request?
- How is the `userName` parameter used in the chat completion request?
