Summary:
This file exports a function called `OpenAIStream` which takes in a payload, extra data, and a callback function. It makes a POST request to the OpenAI API with the payload, and then creates a ReadableStream that parses the response from the API and sends it back to the caller through the callback function.

Import statements:
This file imports two functions from external dependencies: `createParser` and `ParsedEvent` from `eventsource-parser`, and `inngest` from `./ingest/client`. It also imports an interface called `CompletionResponse`.

Script Summary:
This file exports a function called `OpenAIStream` which takes in a payload, extra data, and a callback function. It makes a POST request to the OpenAI API with the payload, and then creates a ReadableStream that parses the response from the API and sends it back to the caller through the callback function.

Internal Functions:
- `onParse`: This function takes in an event and parses it. If the event is of type `ParsedEvent`, it extracts the text from the response and sends it to the controller to be enqueued. If the event is of type `ReconnectInterval`, it does nothing.
- `start`: This function is called when the ReadableStream is started. It initializes the encoder and decoder, sends the extra data to the controller, and then creates a parser to parse the response from the API. It then loops through the chunks of data from the response, decodes them, and feeds them to the parser. Once the parsing is complete, it sends the final response to the callback function and closes the controller.

External Functions:
- `OpenAIStream`: This function takes in a payload, extra data, and a callback function. It makes a POST request to the OpenAI API with the payload, and then creates a ReadableStream that parses the response from the API and sends it back to the caller through the callback function.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API by making a POST request and parsing the response. It also interacts with the rest of the application by sending the parsed response back to the caller through the callback function.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the payload that needs to be passed to `OpenAIStream`?
- What is the structure of the extra data that needs to be passed to `OpenAIStream`?
- What is the format of the response that will be sent to the callback function?
- How can I test this function to make sure it is working correctly?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There are no known issues or bugs with this component.
- The TODO in the code suggests that tokens consumed in the completion should be added to the response, but this has not been implemented yet.
