Summary:
This file contains a function called summarizeAI that uses OpenAI's language processing capabilities to summarize text. It splits the input text into smaller chunks, sends each chunk to OpenAI's API to generate a summary, and then combines all the summaries into a final summary.

Import statements:
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from 'langchain/text_splitter': A class that splits text into smaller chunks recursively.
- randomUUID from 'crypto': A function that generates a random UUID.
- openai from './openai/client': An object that contains functions for interacting with OpenAI's API.
- Document from 'langchain/dist/document': A class that represents a document of text.

Script Summary:
- The summarizeAI function takes in an input string, a prompt string, a chunk size, a max tokens value, and an optional ID string.
- It splits the input string into smaller chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class.
- It sends each chunk to OpenAI's API to generate a summary using the createCompletion function from the openai object.
- It combines all the summaries into a final summary.
- It returns the final summary as a string.

Internal Functions:
- sleep(ms: number): A function that returns a Promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds.
- timeout(ms: number): A function that returns a Promise that rejects with an error after a specified number of milliseconds.

External Functions:
- summarizeAI({ input, prompt, chunkSize = 4000, maxTokens = 1000, id }): A function that takes in an input string, a prompt string, a chunk size, a max tokens value, and an optional ID string. It returns a Promise that resolves with a final summary string.

Interaction Summary:
- This file interacts with OpenAI's API to generate summaries of text.
- It may interact with other parts of the application that use the summarizeAI function to generate summaries of text.

Developer Questions:
- What is the maximum chunk size that can be used?
- What is the maximum number of tokens that can be used?
- How can I test the summarizeAI function without making API calls to OpenAI?
- How can I handle errors that occur when generating summaries?
