Summary:
This file contains the ConfluenceClient class, which is responsible for interacting with the Confluence API to retrieve data about Confluence pages and spaces. It uses Redis for caching and Axios for making HTTP requests.

Import statements:
- axios: a library for making HTTP requests
- Redis: a library for working with Redis
- ConfluencePage, ConfluenceSpace: custom types used in the application
- redisLoader: a utility function for loading data from Redis

Script Summary:
- Defines the ConfluenceClient class, which has methods for retrieving Confluence pages and spaces, as well as handling rate limiting and caching data in Redis.

Internal Functions:
- handleRateLimit: waits for a specified amount of time when the API returns a rate limit error
- getAppData: retrieves data about the application from the Atlassian API
- getCloudId: retrieves the ID of the Confluence cloud associated with the application
- getSpaces: retrieves a list of Confluence spaces
- fetchConfluenceData: retrieves data from the Confluence API, with an option to cache the data in Redis
- getConfluencePage: retrieves data for a specific Confluence page
- getConfluencePages: retrieves data for all Confluence pages, with pagination support

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Confluence API to retrieve data about Confluence pages and spaces. It also interacts with Redis to cache data and improve performance. Other parts of the application may use the ConfluenceClient class to retrieve Confluence data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the data returned by the Confluence API?
- How does Redis caching work in this application?
- How are errors handled when retrieving data from the Confluence API?
- How can I use the ConfluenceClient class to retrieve data in other parts of the application?
