Summary:
This file exports a class called `SlackObject` that extends another class called `AnswersObject`. It also contains a static function called `convertTimestampToDate` that takes a timestamp and converts it to a date object.

Import statements:
The file imports a class called `AnswersObject` from a file located at `"../../core/models/answersObject"`.

Script Summary:
The `SlackObject` class extends the `AnswersObject` class and adds no additional functionality. The `convertTimestampToDate` function takes a timestamp as a string and converts it to a date object.

Internal Functions:
- `constructor(object)`: This is the constructor for the `SlackObject` class. It takes an object as a parameter and passes it to the constructor of the `AnswersObject` class using the `super` keyword.

- `convertTimestampToDate(timestamp)`: This is a static function that takes a timestamp as a string and converts it to a date object. It first removes the microseconds from the timestamp, then converts it to a Unix timestamp (in seconds), and finally multiplies it by 1000 to convert it to a JavaScript timestamp (in milliseconds). It returns the resulting date object.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This file does not interact with any other parts of the application directly. However, it is used as a dependency by other parts of the application that need to work with Slack data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the timestamp string that `convertTimestampToDate` expects?
- What is the expected format of the object that is passed to the `SlackObject` constructor?
- What is the purpose of the `AnswersObject` class that `SlackObject` extends?

Known Issues and TODOs:
None.
