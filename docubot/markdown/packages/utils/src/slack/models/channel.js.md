Summary:
This file exports a class called SlackChannel that interacts with the Slack API to retrieve information about a specific channel and its messages. It also has a cache to store previously retrieved information to reduce API calls.

Import statements:
The file imports a class called SlackMessage from a file called message.

Script Summary:
The SlackChannel class has a constructor that takes in a Slack API client and a channel object. It stores the Slack API client and the channel ID in instance variables and initializes a cache object with the channel information and an empty array for messages.

The class has two async functions: getInfo() and getMessages(). getInfo() retrieves the channel information from the cache if it exists, otherwise it makes an API call to get the information and stores it in the cache before returning it. getMessages() retrieves the messages from the cache if they exist, otherwise it makes API calls to retrieve all the messages in the channel and stores them in the cache before returning them. It also creates a SlackMessage object for each message and replaces any user IDs with user objects in the message text if the message mentions any users.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- SlackChannel constructor: Takes in a Slack API client and a channel object and initializes instance variables and a cache object.
- getInfo(): Retrieves the channel information from the cache if it exists, otherwise it makes an API call to get the information and stores it in the cache before returning it.
- getMessages(): Retrieves the messages from the cache if they exist, otherwise it makes API calls to retrieve all the messages in the channel and stores them in the cache before returning them.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Slack API to retrieve information about a specific channel and its messages. It could be used by other parts of the application to display channel information and messages to users.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application use this class?
- How can I test this class without making actual API calls to Slack?
- What happens if the Slack API returns an error?

Known Issues and TODOs:
