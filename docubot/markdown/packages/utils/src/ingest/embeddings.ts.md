Summary:
This file defines an event handler function that processes vectors upserted into a Pinecone index. It extracts the parent IDs from the new vectors, fetches all the vectors with parent IDs from Pinecone, creates embeddings for the text in the vectors using OpenAI, and writes the resulting vector data to the Pinecone index.

Import statements:
- PineconeClient from '../pinecone/client': imports the PineconeClient class from the '../pinecone/client' module.
- EventVersionHandler from './EventVersionHandler': imports the EventVersionHandler type from the './EventVersionHandler' module.
- PineconeVector from 'types': imports the PineconeVector type from the 'types' module.
- OpenAI from '../openai/openai': imports the OpenAI class from the '../openai/openai' module.

Script Summary:
- Creates an instance of the OpenAI class.
- Creates an instance of the PineconeClient class with the namespace and index name from environment variables.
- Defines an event handler function that processes vectors upserted into a Pinecone index.
- Extracts the parent IDs from the new vectors, fetches all the vectors with parent IDs from Pinecone, creates embeddings for the text in the vectors using OpenAI, and writes the resulting vector data to the Pinecone index.

Internal Functions:
- None.

External Functions:
- None.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Pinecone and OpenAI APIs to process vectors upserted into a Pinecone index. It also depends on environment variables for the namespace and index name.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the data in the vectors array?
- How does the OpenAI.createEmbedding() method work?
- What happens if DISABLE_EMBEDDING is set to true?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- TODO: Extract all the parentIDs from the new vectors.
- TODO: Fetch all the vectors with parentIDs from Pinecone.
- TODO: Delete the processed vectors.
- There are no known issues or bugs with this component.
