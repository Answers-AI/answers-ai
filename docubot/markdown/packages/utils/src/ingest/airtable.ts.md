Summary:
This file contains code that processes data from Airtable and sends it to Pinecone, a third-party service that provides vector search and similarity matching. The code retrieves records from Airtable, processes them to create Pinecone objects, and then sends them to Pinecone for embedding.

Import statements:
- `inngest` from `./client`: a custom client for Pinecone's API
- `Airtable` from `airtable`: a library for interacting with Airtable's API
- `EventVersionHandler` from `./EventVersionHandler`: a custom event handler
- `AirtableRecord` from `types`: a custom type for Airtable records
- `chunkArray` from `../utilities/utils`: a utility function for chunking arrays

Script Summary:
- Defines a batch size for Pinecone vectors
- Defines a function to generate an NLP summary from an Airtable record
- Defines a function to create Pinecone objects from an array of Airtable records
- Defines a function to send Pinecone objects to Pinecone for embedding
- Defines a function to retrieve records from Airtable
- Defines an event handler that retrieves records from Airtable, processes them, and sends them to Pinecone

Internal Functions:
- `getNLPSummary(record: object)`: takes an Airtable record and returns an NLP summary string
- `getAirtablePineconeObject(airtableRecords: AirtableRecord[]): Promise<any[]>`: takes an array of Airtable records and returns an array of Pinecone objects
- `embedVectors(event: any, vectors: any[]): Promise<void[]>`: takes an event object and an array of Pinecone objects and sends them to Pinecone for embedding
- `getAirtableRecords(base: any): Promise<any[]>`: takes an Airtable base object and returns an array of Airtable records

External Functions:
- `processAirtable({ event }): Promise<void>`: an event handler that retrieves records from Airtable, processes them, and sends them to Pinecone for embedding

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with Airtable's API and Pinecone's API. It retrieves records from Airtable, processes them to create Pinecone objects, and then sends them to Pinecone for embedding.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the Airtable records being processed?
- What is the expected format of Pinecone objects?
- How are Pinecone vectors being chunked?
- How can I test the Pinecone embedding functionality?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- TODO: Move Pinecone vectors batch size to a config file
- TODO: Add options in types index.js for DataSourcesFilter and AirtableFilterOptions
- TODO: Chunk Pinecone vectors by tokens
- TODO: Add tests for Pinecone embedding functionality
