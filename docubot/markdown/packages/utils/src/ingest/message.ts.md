Summary:
This file contains code that handles the event of a message being sent in a chat. It retrieves the chat history, updates the chat title using an AI model, and saves the message to the database.

Import statements:
- `prisma` from `db/dist`: an ORM for database access
- `AnswersFilters`, `User`, and `Chat` from `types`: custom types used in the code
- `EventVersionHandler` from `./EventVersionHandler`: a custom type for handling events
- `openai` from `../openai/client`: a client for OpenAI's GPT-3 API
- `upsertChat` from `../upsertChat`: a function for updating or creating a chat in the database

Script Summary:
- `answersMessageSent` is an event handler that takes in a chat ID, filters, user, role, and content as parameters.
- It retrieves the chat history from the database, updates the chat title using an AI model, and saves the message to the database.
- `AIUpdateChatTitle` is a helper function that updates the chat title using OpenAI's GPT-3 API.

Internal Functions:
- `AIUpdateChatTitle`: takes in a chat history and chat ID as parameters, generates a prompt for the GPT-3 API, sends the prompt to the API, retrieves the generated title, and updates the chat title in the database.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the database through Prisma, the OpenAI GPT-3 API through the `openai` client, and another function in the codebase through `upsertChat`.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the `AnswersFilters` type?
- What is the purpose of the `upsertChat` function?
- How is the `openai` client initialized and authenticated?
- What other events trigger the `answersMessageSent` handler?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- TODO: Save more information from the message sent (i.e context, history, completion request, completion response) to the database.
