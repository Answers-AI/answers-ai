Summary:
This file is responsible for processing Algolia search results, splitting the content into smaller chunks, and embedding the vectors using the Pinecone service. It exports a single function `processAlgoliaSearch` which is an event version handler.

Import statements:
- `inngest` from './client': A client for sending events to the Inngest service.
- `EventVersionHandler` from './EventVersionHandler': A type definition for event version handlers.
- `chunkArray` from '../utilities/utils': A utility function to split an array into smaller chunks.
- `AlgoliaHit` from 'types': A type definition for Algolia search results.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from 'langchain/text_splitter': A class for splitting text into smaller chunks.
- `algoliasearch`, `SearchClient`, `SearchIndex` from 'algoliasearch': A library for interacting with the Algolia search service.

Script Summary:
The script processes Algolia search results, splits the content into smaller chunks, and embeds the vectors using the Pinecone service.

Internal Functions:
- `prefixHeaders(markdown: string): string`: Adds prefixes to headers in the given markdown string and returns the modified string.
- `splitPageHtmlChunkMore(markdownChunk: string)`: Splits a markdown chunk into smaller chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
- `splitPageHtml(algoliaHit: AlgoliaHit)`: Splits the content of an Algolia search result into smaller chunks.
- `getAlgoliaVectors(algoliaHits: AlgoliaHit[])`: Converts Algolia search results into a format suitable for embedding vectors.
- `embedVectors(event: any, vectors: any[])`: Embeds the vectors using the Pinecone service.

External Functions:
- `processAlgoliaSearch`: An event version handler for processing Algolia search results.

Interaction Summary:
This file is primarily used as an event version handler for processing Algolia search results. It interacts with the Algolia search service to fetch search results and the Pinecone service to embed vectors.

Developer Questions:
- How does the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter work?
- How are the vectors embedded using the Pinecone service?
- What is the purpose of the `inngest` client?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- Improve error handling for missing or invalid input parameters.
- Add more detailed comments and documentation for the internal functions.
- Refactor the code to make it more modular and maintainable.
