Summary:
This file is responsible for processing Algolia search results, splitting the content into smaller chunks, and embedding the vectors using the Inngest client. It exports a single function `processAlgoliaSearch` which is an event version handler.

Import statements:
- inngest: Imported from './client', used for sending events to Inngest.
- EventVersionHandler: Imported from './EventVersionHandler', used for defining the event version handler.
- chunkArray: Imported from '../utilities/utils', used for splitting arrays into smaller chunks.
- AlgoliaHit: Imported from 'types', a type definition for Algolia search results.
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: Imported from 'langchain/text_splitter', used for splitting text into smaller chunks.
- algoliasearch, SearchClient, SearchIndex: Imported from 'algoliasearch', used for interacting with the Algolia search API.

Script Summary:
This script processes Algolia search results, splits the content into smaller chunks, and embeds the vectors using the Inngest client.

Internal Functions:
- prefixHeaders(markdown: string): Takes a markdown string, prefixes headers, and returns the modified markdown string.
- splitPageHtmlChunkMore(markdownChunk: string): Takes a markdown chunk and returns an array of smaller chunks.
- splitPageHtml(algoliaHit: AlgoliaHit): Takes an AlgoliaHit object and returns an array of smaller chunks.
- getAlgoliaVectors(algoliaHits: AlgoliaHit[]): Takes an array of AlgoliaHit objects and returns an array of vectors.
- embedVectors(event: any, vectors: any[]): Takes an event and an array of vectors, embeds the vectors using the Inngest client, and returns an array of embedded vectors.

External Functions:
- processAlgoliaSearch: An event version handler that processes Algolia search results, splits the content into smaller chunks, and embeds the vectors using the Inngest client.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Algolia search API to fetch search results and process them. It also interacts with the Inngest client to send events and embed vectors.

Developer Questions:
1. How does the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter work and what are its limitations?
2. What is the purpose of splitting the content into smaller chunks?
3. How does the Inngest client handle the embedded vectors?
4. Are there any performance concerns when processing large Algolia search results?
5. How can this script be extended to support additional search APIs or data sources?
