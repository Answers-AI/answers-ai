Summary:
This file is responsible for handling Jira-related events and processing Jira issues and projects. It interacts with the Jira API, OpenAI API, and the Inngest API to fetch, process, and store data related to Jira issues and projects.

Import statements:
- Importing types, utility functions, and API clients from various modules.
- Importing the OpenAI API and initializing it with an API key.

Script Summary:
The script contains three main event handlers: processJiraUpdated, procesProjectUpdated, and processUpsertedIssues. These handlers are responsible for processing Jira issues and projects, fetching data from the Jira API, converting data to the required format, and sending it to the Inngest API.

Internal Functions:

External Functions:
- processJiraUpdated: Handles the 'jira/app.sync' event and processes updated Jira projects.
- procesProjectUpdated: Handles the 'jira/project.sync' event and processes updated Jira issues.
- processUpsertedIssues: Handles the 'jira/issues.upserted' event and processes upserted Jira issues.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Jira API to fetch data related to Jira issues and projects. It also interacts with the OpenAI API to generate summaries for Jira issue comments. Finally, it interacts with the Inngest API to send processed data for storage.

Developer Questions:
1. How are the Jira API credentials being passed to the Jira client?
2. How does the OpenAI API handle large amounts of text for summarization?
3. How does the Inngest API handle large payloads of data?
4. Are there any rate limits or restrictions on the Jira, OpenAI, or Inngest APIs that need to be considered?
5. How can the performance of this script be optimized for large numbers of Jira issues and projects?
