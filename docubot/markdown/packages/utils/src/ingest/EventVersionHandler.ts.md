Summary:
This file contains a function that creates Inngest functions based on a list of event handlers. It also defines types for event handlers and event version handlers.

Import statements:
- `inngest` from './client': a third-party library for handling event ingestion
- `AppSettings` from 'types': a type definition for application settings
- `User` from 'db/generated/prisma-client': a type definition for a user object
- `createStepTools` from 'inngest/components/InngestStepTools': a function for creating step tools

Script Summary:
The `createInngestFunctions` function takes in a list of event version handlers and returns an array of Inngest functions. It groups the event version handlers by event name and version, and creates an Inngest function for each event. When an event is received, the corresponding event handler is called and the result is returned.

Internal Functions:
- `createInngestFunctions(eventHandlers: EventVersionHandler<unknown>[]) => inngestFunctions`: creates Inngest functions based on a list of event version handlers. Parameters:
  - `eventHandlers`: an array of event version handlers. Each handler has an event name, version, and handler function.
  - Returns an array of Inngest functions.

External Functions:
- `EventHandler<T>(args: { event: { v: string; data: T; user?: User; ts: number }; step: ReturnType<typeof createStepTools<any, any>>[0]; }) => Promise<unknown>`: a type definition for an event handler function. Parameters:
  - `args`: an object with two properties:
    - `event`: an object with properties `v` (version), `data` (event data), `user` (optional user object), and `ts` (timestamp).
    - `step`: a step object created by `createStepTools`.
  - Returns a promise that resolves to an unknown value.

- `EventVersionHandler<T> = { event: string; v: string; handler: EventHandler<T>; }`: a type definition for an event version handler. Properties:
  - `event`: the name of the event.
  - `v`: the version of the event.
  - `handler`: an event handler function.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Inngest library to create and handle events. It also interacts with other parts of the application through the event handlers and the types defined in this file.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the event data?
- How are event handlers registered and called?
- What is the purpose of the `createStepTools` function and how is it used?
- How are errors handled in the event handlers?
