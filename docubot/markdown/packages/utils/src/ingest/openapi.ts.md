Summary:
This file contains functions for ingesting and processing OpenAPI specifications from the API Guru website. It includes functions for syncing a list of OpenAPI specs, syncing a list of domains, and syncing a single OpenAPI spec. The file also includes helper functions for processing OpenAPI specs and generating metadata.

Import statements:
- axios: a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
- URL: a built-in Node.js module for working with URLs
- inngest: a custom client for sending data to an internal data pipeline
- openApiLoader: a custom loader for loading OpenAPI specs
- EventVersionHandler: a custom type for defining event handlers
- chunkArray: a custom utility function for chunking arrays
- OpenApiProvider: a custom type for defining OpenAPI providers

Script Summary:
- Defines a constant for the batch size of Pinecone vectors
- Defines an interface for options when syncing a list of domains
- Defines a function for checking if two URLs have matching domains
- Defines a function for getting x-origin URLs from an OpenAPI provider
- Defines an event handler for syncing a list of OpenAPI specs from the API Guru website
- Defines a function for prefixing headers in OpenAPI markdown
- Defines an event handler for syncing a list of OpenAPI specs for a given domain
- Defines an event handler for syncing a single OpenAPI spec

Internal Functions:
- isDomainMatch(url1: string | undefined, url2: string | undefined): boolean
  - Checks if two URLs have matching domains
  - Parameters:
    - url1: a string representing the first URL
    - url2: a string representing the second URL
  - Returns: a boolean indicating if the domains match
- getXOriginUrls(json: OpenApiProvider, options: GuruListOptions = {}): string[]
  - Gets x-origin URLs from an OpenAPI provider
  - Parameters:
    - json: an OpenApiProvider object representing the OpenAPI provider
    - options: an optional object with domain, format, and version options
  - Returns: an array of strings representing the x-origin URLs
- prefixHeaders(markdown: string): string
  - Prefixes headers in OpenAPI markdown
  - Parameters:
    - markdown: a string representing the OpenAPI markdown
  - Returns: a string with the prefixed headers

External Functions:
- processOpenApiGuruList: EventVersionHandler<{ format?: string[]; version?: string }>
  - Event handler for syncing a list of OpenAPI specs from the API Guru website
  - Parameters:
    - event: an object representing the event being handled
  - Returns: none
- processOpenApiDomainList: EventVersionHandler<{
  format?: string;
  version?: string;
  urls: string[];
}>
  - Event handler for syncing a list of OpenAPI specs for a given domain
  - Parameters:
    - event: an object representing the event being handled
  - Returns: none
- processOpenApiUrl: EventVersionHandler<{ urls: string[] }>
  - Event handler for syncing a single OpenAPI spec
  - Parameters:
    - event: an object representing the event being handled
  - Returns: none

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the API Guru website to sync OpenAPI specs. It also interacts with an internal data pipeline to send data for processing.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the OpenAPI loader?
- How are Pinecone vectors generated from OpenAPI specs?
- What is the purpose of the prefixHeaders function?
- How are events handled in this file?
- What is the format of the data sent to the internal data pipeline?
