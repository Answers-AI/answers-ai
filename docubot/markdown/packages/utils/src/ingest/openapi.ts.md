Summary:
This file contains functions to process OpenAPI Guru lists, domain lists, and URLs, and interacts with the Inngest client to send events. It also processes OpenAPI specifications and converts them to Markdown format.

Import statements:
- axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
- URL: A built-in module to work with URLs.
- inngest: The Inngest client for sending events.
- openApiLoader: A utility to load OpenAPI specifications.
- EventVersionHandler: A type definition for event version handlers.
- chunkArray: A utility function to split arrays into chunks.
- OpenApiProvider: A type definition for OpenAPI providers.
- openApiToMarkdown: A utility function to convert OpenAPI specifications to Markdown format.

Script Summary:
This script contains functions to process OpenAPI Guru lists, domain lists, and URLs, and interacts with the Inngest client to send events. It also processes OpenAPI specifications and converts them to Markdown format.

Internal Functions:
- isDomainMatch(url1, url2): Checks if two URLs have the same domain. Returns a boolean.
- getXOriginUrls(json, options): Returns an array of x-origin URLs from the given OpenAPI provider JSON and options.
- prefixHeaders(markdown): Adds header prefixes to the given Markdown content. Returns the modified Markdown content.

External Functions:
- processOpenApiGuruList: An event version handler for processing OpenAPI Guru lists.
- processOpenApiDomainList: An event version handler for processing OpenAPI domain lists.
- processOpenApiUrl: An event version handler for processing OpenAPI URLs.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Inngest client to send events and the openApiLoader utility to load OpenAPI specifications. It also uses the openApiToMarkdown utility to convert OpenAPI specifications to Markdown format.

Developer Questions:
- How do I add a new event version handler for a different type of OpenAPI list?
- How can I modify the Markdown conversion process for OpenAPI specifications?
- What are the possible options for the getXOriginUrls function?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There might be edge cases in the isDomainMatch function that are not covered.
- The processOpenApiUrl function assumes that the OpenAPI specifications are valid and does not handle errors in the conversion process.
- The prefixHeaders function might not handle all possible Markdown header formats.
