Summary:
This file contains code for ingesting Slack messages and processing them for embedding. It imports dependencies from other files and exports functions for processing Slack messages.

Import statements:
- PineconeClient: imports PineconeClient from '../pinecone/client'
- chunkArray: imports chunkArray function from '../utilities/utils'
- inngest: imports inngest function from './client'
- EventVersionHandler: imports EventVersionHandler from './EventVersionHandler'
- AppSettings, SlackChannel, SlackMessage: imports types from 'types'
- SlackMessageModel: imports SlackMessageModel from '../slack/models/message'
- prepareAllForEmbedding: imports prepareAllForEmbedding function from '../prepareAllForEmbedding'
- SlackClient: imports SlackClient from '../slack/client'
- getUserClients: imports getUserClients function from '../auth/getUserClients'

Script Summary:
- Defines constants for batch sizes and disabling embedding
- Defines three functions for processing Slack messages: processSlackUpdated, procesChannelUpdated, and processMessageEmbeddingsUpserted
- Creates a PineconeClient instance
- Exports the three processing functions

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- processSlackUpdated: processes Slack messages by chunking them into batches and sending them to inngest for ingestion
  - Parameters: event object containing user and appSettings
  - Returns: none
- procesChannelUpdated: processes Slack messages by getting messages from selected channels and sending them to inngest for ingestion
  - Parameters: event object containing channels and user
  - Returns: none
- processMessageEmbeddingsUpserted: processes Slack messages by preparing them for embedding and writing them to Pinecone index
  - Parameters: event object containing messages
  - Returns: none

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with other files in the application through its import statements. It uses PineconeClient from '../pinecone/client' to write Slack messages to the Pinecone index. It also uses functions from other files such as chunkArray from '../utilities/utils', inngest from './client', SlackMessageModel from '../slack/models/message', prepareAllForEmbedding from '../prepareAllForEmbedding', SlackClient from '../slack/client', and getUserClients from '../auth/getUserClients'.
