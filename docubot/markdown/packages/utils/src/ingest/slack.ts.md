Summary:
This file contains code that handles syncing data between a Slack workspace and a third-party service. It includes event handlers for syncing channels and messages, as well as functions for chunking arrays and preparing data for embedding.

Import statements:
- PineconeClient: a third-party library for working with Pinecone, a vector search engine
- chunkArray: a utility function for splitting an array into smaller chunks
- inngest: a custom client for sending data to a third-party service
- EventVersionHandler: a custom type for defining event handlers
- AppSettings, SlackChannel, SlackMessage: custom types for defining data structures
- SlackMessageModel: a custom model for working with Slack messages
- SlackClient: a custom client for interacting with the Slack API
- getUserClients: a custom function for retrieving user clients

Script Summary:
The script defines three event handlers for syncing data between a Slack workspace and a third-party service. The `processSlackUpdated` handler syncs channels, the `procesChannelUpdated` handler syncs messages for specific channels, and the `processMessageEmbeddingsUpserted` handler prepares message data for embedding and writes it to a vector search engine.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- processSlackUpdated: an event handler for syncing channels between a Slack workspace and a third-party service
- procesChannelUpdated: an event handler for syncing messages for specific channels between a Slack workspace and a third-party service
- processMessageEmbeddingsUpserted: an event handler for preparing message data for embedding and writing it to a vector search engine

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Slack API, a third-party service for sending data, and Pinecone, a vector search engine. It also relies on custom models, clients, and utility functions defined elsewhere in the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the third-party service being used for data syncing?
- How are channels and messages selected for syncing?
- What is the purpose of the `prepareAllForEmbedding` function?
- How is user authentication handled for interacting with the Slack API?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- None
