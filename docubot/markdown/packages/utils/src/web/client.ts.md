Summary:
This file defines a class called WebClient that fetches web data from a given URL and caches it using Redis. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests and the ioredis library to interact with Redis.

Import statements:
The file imports two external libraries: axios and ioredis. It also imports AxiosError from axios.

Script Summary:
The file defines a class called WebClient that has a constructor and a single function called fetchWebData. The constructor initializes the Redis client, sets default headers, and sets the cache expiration time. The fetchWebData function takes a URL and an optional cache parameter and returns the data from the URL. If the cache parameter is true, it first checks Redis for cached data and returns that if it exists. If there is no cached data, it makes an HTTP request to the URL using axios and caches the response in Redis.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- fetchWebData(url: string, { cache = true }: { cache?: boolean } = {}): This function takes a URL and an optional cache parameter and returns the data from the URL. If the cache parameter is true, it first checks Redis for cached data and returns that if it exists. If there is no cached data, it makes an HTTP request to the URL using axios and caches the response in Redis.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with Redis to cache data and with axios to make HTTP requests. It could be used by other parts of the application to fetch web data and cache it for future use.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if Redis is not available?
- How can I modify the default headers used in HTTP requests?
- How can I modify the cache expiration time?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There is a custom implementation of caching around the axios call due to an issue with the axios-cache-adapter library. This should be removed once the issue is fixed.
- There is a TODO to add a handler for HTTP requests with a status code of 429 (rate limit exceeded).
