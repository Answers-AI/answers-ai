Summary:
This file exports a class called AnswersObject, which is used to create an object that can be embedded and vectorized using OpenAI's API. The class has functions to create a context from an object, prepare the object for embedding, create an embedding, and create a vector.

Import statements:
- OpenAI: a third-party library for interfacing with OpenAI's API
- Vector: a custom utility class for creating vectors

Script Summary:
- Defines a constant called embeddingJoinSeparator, which is a space character
- Defines a class called AnswersObject, which takes an object as a parameter and has functions to create a context from the object, prepare the object for embedding, create an embedding, and create a vector
- The createContextFromObject function takes an object and returns a string that is used as the context for the embedding. It filters out certain values and formats the remaining values into a string.
- The prepareForEmbedding function calls the createContextFromObject function, creates an embedding using OpenAI's API, and creates a vector using the embedding and the object's unique identifier.
- The createEmbedding function calls OpenAI's API to create an embedding for the object's context.
- The createVector function creates a vector using the object's unique identifier, the object itself, and the embedding.

Internal Functions:
- createContextFromObject(obj): takes an object as a parameter and returns a string that is used as the context for the embedding
- prepareForEmbedding(): prepares the object for embedding by creating a context, embedding, and vector
- createEmbedding(): creates an embedding using OpenAI's API
- createVector(): creates a vector using the object's unique identifier, the object itself, and the embedding

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with OpenAI's API to create embeddings for objects. It also uses a custom Vector class to create vectors.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the object that is passed to the AnswersObject constructor?
- How does the createContextFromObject function filter out certain values?
- What is the purpose of the vector that is created in the prepareForEmbedding function?
- How does the createEmbedding function interact with OpenAI's API?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- None
