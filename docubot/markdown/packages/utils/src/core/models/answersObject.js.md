Summary:
The answersObject.js file contains a class called AnswersObject that is responsible for creating an embedding and vector for a given object. It uses the OpenAI API to create the embedding and a Vector class to create the vector.

Import statements:
- OpenAI: an external module that provides access to the OpenAI API
- Vector: an internal module that creates a vector object

Script Summary:
- The AnswersObject class takes an object as a parameter and creates an embedding and vector for it.
- The createContextFromObject function creates a context string from the object by filtering out certain values and formatting the remaining values.
- The prepareForEmbedding function calls createContextFromObject and creates the embedding and vector.
- The createEmbedding function uses the OpenAI API to create an embedding for the context string.
- The createVector function creates a vector object using the object's type, uid, and embedding.

Internal Functions:
- createContextFromObject(obj): creates a context string from the object by filtering out certain values and formatting the remaining values. Returns the context string.
- createEmbedding(): uses the OpenAI API to create an embedding for the context string. Returns the embedding.
- createVector(): creates a vector object using the object's type, uid, and embedding. Returns the vector object.

External Functions:
- constructor(object): creates a new AnswersObject instance with the given object.
- getContext(): calls createContextFromObject and returns the context string.
- prepareForEmbedding(): calls getContext, createEmbedding, and createVector to create the embedding and vector. Returns the vector object.

Interaction Summary:
The AnswersObject class is used to create embeddings and vectors for objects in the larger application. It interacts with the OpenAI API to create the embeddings and with the Vector class to create the vectors.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the object parameter for the AnswersObject constructor?
- What values are filtered out in the createContextFromObject function?
- How does the OpenAI API work and what are its limitations?
- What is the Vector class and how does it create vectors?
- How are the embeddings and vectors used in the larger application?
