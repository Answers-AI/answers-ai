Summary:
This file contains a function called buildSettings that is used to build the settings object for a user or organization. It imports various dependencies and types, including deepmerge, JiraProject, SlackClient, User, AppSettings, Organization, ConfluenceSpaceSetting, and SlackChannelSetting.

Import statements:
- deepmerge: a utility function for merging objects
- JiraProject: a type representing a Jira project
- SlackClient: a class for interacting with the Slack API
- User: a type representing a user
- AppSettings: a type representing application settings
- Organization: a type representing an organization
- ConfluenceSpaceSetting: a type representing a Confluence space setting

Script Summary:
The buildSettings function takes a user and an optional organization as parameters. It uses the getUserClients function to get Jira, Confluence, and Slack clients for the user. It then merges the user's appSettings, the organization's appSettings, and the SYSTEM_SETTINGS object using deepmerge to create a new settings object. If a Jira client is available, it loads all possible Jira projects and merges them with any existing project settings in the new settings object. If a Slack client is available, it loads all possible Slack channels and merges them with any existing channel settings in the new settings object. If a Confluence client is available, it loads all possible Confluence spaces and merges them with any existing space settings in the new settings object. Finally, it creates url and domain settings objects for the web section of the new settings object.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- getUserClients: a function that takes a user as a parameter and returns Jira, Confluence, and Slack clients for that user
