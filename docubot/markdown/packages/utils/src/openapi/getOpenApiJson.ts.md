Summary:
This file exports a single function `getOpenApiJson` which fetches OpenAPI data from a specified URL and returns it as a Promise.

Import statements:
The file imports two modules: `openApiClient` and `OpenAPIV3`. `openApiClient` is a custom module that provides a method for fetching OpenAPI data from a URL. `OpenAPIV3` is a type definition for OpenAPI version 3.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single function `getOpenApiJson` which takes an object with a single property `url` as an argument. The function logs a message to the console indicating that it is fetching OpenAPI data from the specified URL. It then calls the `fetchOpenApiData` method of the `openApiClient` module to fetch the data. If the data is successfully fetched, it is returned as a Promise. If an error occurs during the fetch, the function logs an error message to the console and re-throws the error.
