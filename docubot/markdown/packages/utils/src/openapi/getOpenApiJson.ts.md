Summary:
This file contains a function that fetches OpenAPI data from a specified URL and returns it as a Promise.

Import statements:
- `openApiClient` from `./index`: an internal module that provides a client for fetching OpenAPI data
- `OpenAPIV3` from `openapi-types`: a third-party library that provides types for OpenAPI v3 specifications

Script Summary:
The `getOpenApiJson` function takes a URL as a parameter and uses the `openApiClient` to fetch OpenAPI data from that URL. If the data is successfully fetched, it is returned as a Promise. If there is an error, an error message is logged and the error is thrown.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
- `getOpenApiJson`: a function that takes a URL as a parameter and returns a Promise that resolves to the fetched OpenAPI data.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the `openApiClient` module to fetch OpenAPI data. It could potentially be used by other modules in the application that need to fetch OpenAPI data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the OpenAPI data returned by this function?
- How is the `openApiClient` module implemented and how does it interact with external APIs?
- What happens if the `cache` option is set to `true` when calling `fetchOpenApiData`?
