Summary:
This file contains a class called OpenApiClient which is responsible for fetching data from an OpenAPI endpoint. It also includes a function called blobToString which converts a Blob object to a string.

Import statements:
The file imports axios and Redis. Axios is a popular HTTP client library and Redis is an in-memory data structure store.

Script Summary:
The OpenApiClient class has a constructor that initializes a Redis client and sets default headers and response types. It also has a fetchOpenApiData function that fetches data from an OpenAPI endpoint. If caching is enabled, it checks Redis for cached data before making a request to the endpoint. If data is not cached or caching is disabled, it makes a request to the endpoint and caches the response in Redis.

Internal Functions:
- blobToString: This function takes a Blob object as input and returns a Promise that resolves to a string.

External Functions:
- fetchOpenApiData: This function takes a URL and an optional cache parameter as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the fetched data.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with Redis to cache OpenAPI responses. It also interacts with the axios library to make HTTP requests to OpenAPI endpoints.

Developer Questions:
- How does Redis caching work in this file?
- What is the purpose of the blobToString function?
- How does the fetchOpenApiData function handle different content types?
- How can I disable caching for a specific request?
- What happens if the OpenAPI endpoint returns a non-200 status code?
