Summary:
This file contains a class called OpenApiClient that fetches data from an OpenAPI endpoint and caches it in Redis. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests and the ioredis library to interact with Redis.

Import statements:
- axios: a library for making HTTP requests
- ioredis: a Redis client library
- ResponseType: a type definition for the response type of an axios request

Script Summary:
The OpenApiClient class has a constructor that initializes the Redis client, sets default headers and response types for axios requests, and sets a cache expiration time. It has a fetchOpenApiData method that takes a URL and an optional cache parameter. If cache is true, it checks Redis for cached data before making a request to the OpenAPI endpoint. If cache is false or there is no cached data, it makes a request to the endpoint, parses the response based on the content type, caches the data in Redis, and returns the data.

Internal Functions:
- blobToString: a helper function that takes a Blob object and returns a Promise that resolves to a string. It uses the TextDecoder API to decode the Blob's array buffer.

External Functions:
- OpenApiClient: a class that has a constructor and a fetchOpenApiData method. The constructor takes an optional cacheExpireTime parameter and initializes the Redis client, sets default headers and response types for axios requests, and sets a cache expiration time. The fetchOpenApiData method takes a URL and an optional cache parameter. If cache is true, it checks Redis for cached data before making a request to the OpenAPI endpoint. If cache is false or there is no cached data, it makes a request to the endpoint, parses the response based on the content type, caches the data in Redis, and returns the data.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the larger application by providing a way to fetch data from an OpenAPI endpoint and cache it in Redis. Other parts of the application can use this class to get data from the endpoint without having to make a new request every time.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if Redis is not available?
- What happens if the OpenAPI endpoint returns an error?
- How can I change the default headers or response types for a specific request?
- How can I change the cache expiration time?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There is a custom implementation of caching around the axios request because of an issue with the axios-cache-adapter library. This should be removed once the issue is fixed.
- There is no handler for HTTP requests in the fetchOpenApiData method. This should be added in the future.
- There are no known issues or bugs with this component at this time.
