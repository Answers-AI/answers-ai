Summary:
This file contains a class called JiraThread which extends another class called JiraObject. It has a constructor that takes in a thread object and tidies it up before passing it to the parent constructor. It also has a static method called tidy that takes in a thread object and returns a tidied version of it. There is also a function called createContext that is used to create a context string for the thread. The class has a method called getVectors that returns an array of vectors.

Import statements:
The file imports JiraObject from './jiraObject'.

Script Summary:
The file contains a class called JiraThread that extends JiraObject. It has a constructor that takes in a thread object and tidies it up before passing it to the parent constructor. It also has a static method called tidy that takes in a thread object and returns a tidied version of it. There is also a function called createContext that is used to create a context string for the thread. The class has a method called getVectors that returns an array of vectors.

Internal Functions:
- tidy(thread): This function takes in a thread object and returns a tidied version of it. It extracts the id, issueKey, project, and text properties from the thread object and returns them in a new object.
- createContext(metadata, jiraAdfToMarkdown): This function takes in a metadata object and a function called jiraAdfToMarkdown. It creates a context string for the thread by iterating over the comments in the metadata object and formatting them into a string. It then returns the context string.

External Functions:
- constructor(thread): This function takes in a thread object, tidies it up using the tidy function, and passes it to the parent constructor. It also sets the uid property of the object to the issueKey property of the thread object.
- getVectors(): This function returns an array of vectors. It chunks the comments in the object property of the JiraThread object into groups of 10 and creates a vector for each group. Each vector has an id, text, and objectType property.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a part of a larger application that deals with Jira issues. It extends the JiraObject class and is used to represent a Jira comments thread. It has a method called getVectors that is used to create vectors for the comments in the thread. The createContext function is used to create a context string for the thread.

Developer Questions:
- What is the JiraObject class and how is it used?
- What is the jiraAdfToMarkdown function and where is it defined?
- How is the getVectors function used in the larger application?
- What is the purpose of the createContext function?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There are no known issues or bugs with this component.
- The TODO in the file suggests using a feature flag to determine the context parser. This should be addressed.
