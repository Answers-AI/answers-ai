Summary:
This file contains a function called `getJiraTickets` which retrieves Jira tickets based on a JQL query. It uses the `JiraClient` class to make API calls to Jira and returns an array of `JiraIssue` objects.

Import statements:
- `JiraIssue` from 'types': This is a custom type for Jira issues.
- `JiraClient` from './client': This is a class that handles API calls to Jira.

Script Summary:
The `getJiraTickets` function takes in a `jiraClient` object, a JQL query string, and optional parameters for pagination. It first makes an API call to Jira with the initial pagination parameters to get the total number of tickets. It then makes additional API calls to retrieve all the tickets based on the pagination parameters. It returns an array of `JiraIssue` objects.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
- `fetchJiraData`: This is a method of the `JiraClient` class that makes API calls to Jira.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Jira API through the `JiraClient` class. It could potentially be used by other parts of the application that need to retrieve Jira tickets based on a JQL query.

Developer Questions:
- What is the `JiraClient` class and how does it work?
- How does pagination work in Jira API calls?
- What is the structure of the `JiraIssue` object?
- How can I test this function without making actual API calls to Jira?
