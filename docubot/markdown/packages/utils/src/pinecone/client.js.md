Summary:
This file defines a class called PineconeClient which is used to interact with the Pinecone database. It has functions to delete an index, write a single vector to an index, and write multiple vectors to an index in chunks.

Import statements:
- chunkArray from '../utilities/utils'
- PineconeClient from '@pinecone-database/pinecone'

Script Summary:
- Defines a class called PineconeClient which is used to interact with the Pinecone database.
- Has functions to delete an index, write a single vector to an index, and write multiple vectors to an index in chunks.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): Initializes the PineconeClient object with the given configuration. It sets the API key, environment, namespace, indexName, and calls the init() function.
- async init(): Initializes the Pinecone client with the API key and environment.
- async deleteIndex(index): Deletes the given index.
- async deleteIndexByName(indexName = this.indexName): Deletes the index with the given name.
- async writeVectorToIndex(vector): Writes a single vector to the index.
- async writeVectorsToIndex(vectors): Writes multiple vectors to the index in chunks.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Pinecone database through the PineconeClient class. It can be used to delete an index, write a single vector to an index, and write multiple vectors to an index in chunks.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the vector that is being written to the index?
- How does the chunking of vectors work in writeVectorsToIndex() function?
- What happens if an error occurs while writing vectors to the index?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There are no known issues or bugs with this component.
- There are some TODOs in the code that need to be addressed, such as removing the deleteIndex() calls after testing and adding checks for token size and chunking efficiently.
