Summary:
The PineconeClient class is a utility class that provides methods for interacting with the Pinecone database. It includes methods for initializing the client, deleting an index, and writing vectors to an index.

Import statements:
The file imports the chunkArray function from the utilities/utils module and the PineconeClient class from the @pinecone-database/pinecone module.

Script Summary:
The PineconeClient class constructor takes a configuration object as a parameter, which includes an API key, environment, namespace, and index name. It initializes the Pinecone client and sets the API key, environment, namespace, and index name as properties of the class. It also calls the init method to initialize the client.

The class includes methods for deleting an index, deleting an index by name, and writing vectors to an index. The writeVectorsToIndex method chunks the vectors into smaller arrays and writes them to the index in parallel.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): Initializes the PineconeClient class with the provided configuration object. Throws an error if the API key or environment is missing.
- async init(): Initializes the Pinecone client with the API key and environment.
- async deleteIndex(index): Deletes the specified index.
- async deleteIndexByName(indexName): Deletes the index with the specified name.
- async writeVectorToIndex(vector): Writes a single vector to the index.
- async writeVectorsToIndex(vectors): Chunks the vectors into smaller arrays and writes them to the index in parallel.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
The PineconeClient class is likely used by other modules in the application to interact with the Pinecone database. It could be used to initialize the client, delete an index, or write vectors to an index.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the vectors that can be written to the index?
- How is the namespace used in the methods?
- What happens if an error occurs while writing vectors to the index?
- How can I test the PineconeClient class?
