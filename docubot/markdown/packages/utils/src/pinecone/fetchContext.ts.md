Summary:
This file contains code that interacts with the Pinecone database and OpenAI API to fetch context for a chatbot. It includes functions to parse filters, filter Pinecone data based on relevance threshold, and fetch context based on user input and filters.

Import statements:
- PineconeClient from '@pinecone-database/pinecone': PineconeClient is a class that provides methods to interact with the Pinecone database.
- pineconeQuery from './pineconeQuery': pineconeQuery is a function that queries the Pinecone database for matches based on a given prompt embedding and filter.
- Chat from 'db/generated/prisma-client': Chat is a type generated by Prisma that represents a chat object.
- AnswersFilters, Message, User, Sidekicks, Sidekick from 'types': These are custom types used in the code.
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from 'langchain/text_splitter': RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is a class that provides methods to split text into smaller chunks.
- OpenAIClient from '../openai/openai': OpenAIClient is a class that provides methods to interact with the OpenAI API.
- countTokens from '../utilities/countTokens': countTokens is a function that counts the number of tokens in a given text.

Script Summary:
The script exports a function called fetchContext that takes in a user, prompt, messages, filters, sidekick, and gptModel as parameters. It first parses the filters using the parseFilters function. It then creates an embedding for the prompt using the OpenAI API. It filters the Pinecone data based on relevance threshold using the filterPineconeDataRelevanceThreshhold function. It then fetches the context based on the relevant data using the sidekick's contextStringRender function and the countTokens function. It returns the context and summary.

Internal Functions:
- parseFilters: This function takes in filters as a parameter and returns parsed filters. It converts the spaces array in the confluence datasource to a spaceId array and deletes the spaces array.
- filterPineconeDataRelevanceThreshhold: This function takes in data and threshold as parameters and returns sortedData. It filters out any results that are below the relevance threshold, sorts by score, and returns the sorted data.
- getMaxContextTokens: This function takes in gptModel as a parameter and returns the maximum number of context tokens based on the gptModel.

External Functions:
- fetchContext: This function takes in user, prompt, messages, filters, sidekick, and gptModel as parameters and returns context and summary. It first parses the filters using the parseFilters function. It then creates an embedding for the prompt using the OpenAI API. It filters the Pinecone data based on relevance threshold using the filterPineconeDataRelevanceThreshhold function. It then fetches the context based on the relevant data using the sidekick's contextStringRender function and the countTokens function. It returns the context and summary.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Pinecone database and OpenAI API to fetch context for a chatbot. It also interacts with the sidekick's contextStringRender function and the countTokens function to render the context string and count the number of tokens.

Developer Questions:
- What is the relevance threshold for filtering Pinecone data?
- How does the sidekick's contextStringRender function work?
- How is the maximum number of context tokens calculated based on the gptModel?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- TODO: find a more dynamic way to parse the filters into Pinecone
- TODO: Need to check Postgres for ID and organization
- TODO: We need to scrub the results of any items the user does not have access to
