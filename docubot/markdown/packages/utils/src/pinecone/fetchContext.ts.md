Summary:
This file contains code that fetches context data from a Pinecone database based on user input and filters, splits the data into chunks, summarizes it using an OpenAI model, and returns the summarized context.

Import statements:
The file imports several modules including PineconeClient, pineconeQuery, Chat, AnswersFilters, Message, User, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, OpenAIClient, and summarizeAI.

Script Summary:
The script fetches context data from a Pinecone database based on user input and filters, splits the data into chunks, summarizes it using an OpenAI model, and returns the summarized context.

Internal Functions:
- parseFilters: This function takes in a filter object and returns a parsed filter object with the spaces field replaced with spaceId.
- fetchContext: This function takes in a user object, prompt string, messages array, filters object, and threshold number. It then parses the filters, creates an embedding for the prompt, filters the data based on the filters, splits the data into chunks, summarizes it using an OpenAI model, and returns the summarized context.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Pinecone database, OpenAI model, and other parts of the application that use the fetchContext function.

Developer Questions:
- What is the Pinecone database and how is it structured?
- How does the OpenAI model work and what are its limitations?
- How are filters applied to the Pinecone data?
- How is the context data split into chunks and summarized?
- How is the threshold for filtering determined?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- TODO: find a more dynamic way to parse the filters into Pinecone
- TODO: Use history to generate a more accurate question to search for vectors
- TODO: Figure how to filter by namespace without having to re-index per user
- There are no known issues or bugs with this component at this time.
