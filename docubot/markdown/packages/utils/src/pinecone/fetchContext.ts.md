Summary:
This file contains a function called fetchContext that retrieves context data from a Pinecone database and summarizes it using OpenAI. It takes in a prompt, messages, and filters as parameters and returns the context and summary.

Import statements:
- PineconeClient from '@pinecone-database/pinecone'
- pineconeQuery from './pineconeQuery'
- Chat from 'db/generated/prisma-client'
- AnswersFilters and Message from 'types'
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from 'langchain/text_splitter'
- OpenAIClient from '../openai/openai'
- summarizeAI from '../summarizeAI'

Script Summary:
- Defines constants for summary chunk size, summary token size, context pages, and Pinecone threshold
- Defines fetchContext function that takes in a chat, prompt, messages, filters, and threshold as parameters
- Uses OpenAI to create an embedding for the prompt
- Filters the data based on the models and datasources in the filters parameter
- Queries the Pinecone database for matches based on the prompt embedding and filters
- Filters the matches based on the Pinecone threshold
- Joins the filtered data with the message history and splits it into chunks
- Summarizes the context using OpenAI
- Returns the context and summary

Internal Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
- This file interacts with the Pinecone database and OpenAI to retrieve and summarize context data.
- It may be called by other functions or components in the larger application to retrieve context data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the Pinecone database and how does it work?
- What is OpenAI and how does it summarize text?
- How is the Pinecone threshold calculated and what is its significance?
- What are the models and datasources in the filters parameter and how are they used to filter the data?
- How is the message history used to generate a more accurate question to search for vectors?
- How is the context split into chunks and why is this necessary?
- What happens if there is an error creating documents with Pinecone data or summarizing the context with OpenAI?
- How is the context and summary returned and how can they be used by other components in the application?
