Summary:
This file contains code that initializes and exports instances of the PineconeClient and OpenAIApi classes, as well as a function for querying the Pinecone database. 

Import statements:
- Configuration and OpenAIApi from the 'openai' library
- AnswersFilters from the 'types' library
- PineconeClient from the '@pinecone-database/pinecone' library

Script Summary:
The script initializes instances of the PineconeClient and OpenAIApi classes, and exports them for use in other parts of the application. It also exports a function for querying the Pinecone database using the PineconeClient instance.

Internal Functions:
- initializeOpenAI(): initializes a new instance of the OpenAIApi class using an API key from the environment variables.

External Functions:
- pineconeQuery(embeddings: number[], { filter, topK = 20, namespace = process.env.PINECONE_INDEX_NAMESPACE }: { filter?: any; topK?: number; namespace?: string }): queries the Pinecone database using the PineconeClient instance. It takes in an array of embeddings, and an optional object containing filter, topK, and namespace parameters. It returns a Promise that resolves to the data returned by the Pinecone database.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Pinecone database and the OpenAI API, and exports functions and instances for use in other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the embeddings array that is passed to pineconeQuery?
- What is the expected format of the filter parameter in pineconeQuery?
- How can I set up the environment variables needed for this file to work properly?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- The TODO comment in pineconeQuery suggests that metadata inferred from the question should be used, but this functionality has not been implemented yet. 
- There are no known issues with this file at this time.
