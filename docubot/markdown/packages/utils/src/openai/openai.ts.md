Summary:
This file contains a class called OpenAI that interacts with the OpenAI API to create embeddings for text. It uses Redis for caching and DataLoader for batching requests.

Import statements:
- Configuration, CreateEmbeddingRequestInput, OpenAIApi from 'openai': These are dependencies for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- Redis from 'ioredis': This is a Redis client for caching.
- redisLoader from '../redisLoader': This is a custom DataLoader function for batching requests.

Script Summary:
The OpenAI class has a default model and initializes the OpenAIApi and Redis clients in its constructor. It also initializes a DataLoader instance using the redisLoader function. The class has a single public method called createEmbedding that takes an input and an optional model parameter. It uses the DataLoader instance to batch requests for embeddings and returns the embeddings.

Internal Functions:
- sleep: A utility function that returns a Promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds.

External Functions:
- createEmbedding: A public method that takes an input and an optional model parameter and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of embeddings.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API and Redis for caching. It could be used by other components in the application that need to create embeddings for text.

Developer Questions:
- What is the default model used by the OpenAI class?
- How does the redisLoader function work?
- How can we test if we're hitting rate limits for the OpenAI API?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- There are no known issues or bugs with this component.
- There is a TODO comment to test if we're hitting rate limits for the OpenAI API.
