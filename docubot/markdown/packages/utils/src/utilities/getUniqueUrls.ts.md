Script Summary:
This file exports two functions, `getUniqueUrl` and `getUniqueUrls`, which take in a string or an array of strings representing URLs and return a unique version of the URL(s) with any trailing slashes removed.

Internal Functions:
- `getUniqueUrl(url: string)`: This function takes in a string representing a URL, creates a new `URL` object from it, removes the `www.` from the hostname (if present), removes any trailing slashes from the pathname, and returns a unique version of the URL with any repeated slashes in the pathname replaced by a single slash.

External Functions:
- `getUniqueUrls(urls: string[])`: This function takes in an array of strings representing URLs, maps each URL to its unique version using the `getUniqueUrl` function, removes any duplicates, and returns an array of the unique URLs.

Interaction Summary:
This file is self-contained and does not interact with any other parts of the application or any third-party libraries.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of removing the `www.` from the hostname?
- Why are trailing slashes removed from the pathname?
- What is the purpose of replacing repeated slashes in the pathname with a single slash?
- How does the `Set` object used in `getUniqueUrls` remove duplicates from the array?

Known Issues and TODOs:
None.
