Summary:
This file contains two functions, `getUniqueUrl` and `getUniqueUrls`, which are used to extract unique URLs from an array of URLs.

Import statements:
This file does not have any import statements.

Script Summary:
The `getUniqueUrl` function takes a URL string as input, parses it using the `URL` constructor, extracts the hostname and path, removes any trailing slashes from the path, and returns a new URL string with the hostname and path concatenated together. The `getUniqueUrls` function takes an array of URL strings as input, maps each URL to its unique version using the `getUniqueUrl` function, removes any duplicates using the `Set` constructor, and returns an array of unique URL strings.

Internal Functions:
- `getUniqueUrl(url: string): string`: This function takes a URL string as input and returns a new URL string with the hostname and path concatenated together.
  - Parameters:
    - `url` (string): The URL string to be processed.
  - Returns:
    - A new URL string with the hostname and path concatenated together.

External Functions:
- `getUniqueUrls(urls: string[]): string[]`: This function takes an array of URL strings as input and returns an array of unique URL strings.
  - Parameters:
    - `urls` (string[]): An array of URL strings to be processed.
  - Returns:
    - An array of unique URL strings.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to extract unique URLs from an array of URLs. It could potentially be used in any part of the application that deals with URLs, such as web scraping, API requests, or data analysis.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected input format for the `getUniqueUrls` function?
- How does the `URL` constructor handle invalid URLs?
- What is the performance impact of using the `Set` constructor to remove duplicates?
