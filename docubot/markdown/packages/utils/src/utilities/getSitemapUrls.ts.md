Script Summary:
The extractUrlsFromSitemap function takes a sitemapUrl parameter and returns an array of all URLs listed in the sitemap. It first makes an HTTP GET request to the sitemap URL using axios, then uses cheerio to parse the response HTML and extract all URLs listed in the sitemap. If a URL ends with ".xml", it is assumed to be a nested sitemap and the function is called recursively to extract URLs from the nested sitemap. The function returns an array of all URLs found in the sitemap(s).
