Summary:
This file exports a function that takes a sitemap URL as input and returns an array of all URLs listed in the sitemap, including those listed in any nested sitemaps. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests and the cheerio library to parse HTML.

Import statements:
The file imports two external libraries: axios and cheerio.

Script Summary:
The file exports a single function called extractUrlsFromSitemap. This function takes a sitemapUrl string as input and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of strings. The function makes an HTTP GET request to the sitemapUrl using axios, then uses cheerio to parse the response and extract all URLs listed in the sitemap. If a URL ends with ".xml", the function recursively calls itself with the nested sitemap URL and adds the resulting URLs to the array.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
- extractUrlsFromSitemap(sitemapUrl: string): Promise&lt;string[]&gt;
  - Parameters:
    - sitemapUrl: The URL of the sitemap to process.
  - Returns:
    - A Promise that resolves to an array of all URLs listed in the sitemap.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a standalone module that can be imported and used by other parts of the application that need to extract URLs from sitemaps.

Developer Questions:
- How does the function handle errors when making HTTP requests?
- What happens if the sitemap contains URLs that are not valid or are not accessible?
- How can the function be optimized for performance when processing large sitemaps?

Known Issues and TODOs:
None.
