Summary:
This file exports a function called `countTokens` which accepts a string as input and returns the number of tokens in that string. The tokens are determined by splitting the string on whitespace characters.

Import statements:
The file imports the `CharacterTextSplitter` module from the `langchain/text_splitter` package.

Script Summary:
The `countTokens` function splits the input string on whitespace characters using the `split` method and returns the length of the resulting array.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
- `countTokens(text: string): number`: This function accepts a string as input and returns the number of tokens in that string. The tokens are determined by splitting the string on whitespace characters.

Interaction Summary:
This file does not interact with any other parts of the application. It only exports a single function that can be used by other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the definition of a token in this context?
- Can the function handle non-whitespace delimiters for tokens?
- Are there any performance concerns with using the `split` method for large strings?

Known Issues and TODOs:
None.
