Summary:
This file contains a single function called "chunkArray" which takes an array and a chunk size as input and returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains a chunk of the original array.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this file.

Script Summary:
The "chunkArray" function takes an array and a chunk size as input and returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains a chunk of the original array. The function achieves this by using the "Array.from" method to create a new array with a length equal to the number of chunks required. The second argument to "Array.from" is a function that takes two arguments: the current value and the current index. The function uses the "slice" method to extract a chunk of the original array based on the current index and chunk size.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a utility function that can be used by other parts of the application to split an array into smaller chunks. It does not interact with any other parts of the application directly.

Developer Questions:
- What is the maximum size of the input array that can be processed by this function?
- What happens if the chunk size is larger than the length of the input array?
- Can this function be used with arrays of objects or only with arrays of primitive types?
