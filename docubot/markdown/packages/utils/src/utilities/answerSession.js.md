Summary:
This file contains the AnswerSession class which has methods for initializing Pinecone, adding and replacing vectors, writing vectors to a file, and preparing objects for embedding.

Import statements:
- fs: a Node.js module for working with the file system
- Pinecone: a custom class from '../pinecone/client'

Script Summary:
- AnswerSession class with methods for working with vectors and preparing objects for embedding

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): initializes AnswerSession with a vectors array and assigns properties from config object
- initPinecone(options): creates a new Pinecone instance with options and assigns it to AnswerSession's pinecone property
- addVectors(vectors): adds vectors to AnswerSession's vectors array
- replaceVectors(vectors): replaces AnswerSession's vectors array with new vectors
- clearVectors(): clears AnswerSession's vectors array
- writeVectorsToFile(): writes AnswerSession's vectors to a file in chunks of 1.5MB or less
- prepareAllForEmbedding(objects): prepares objects for embedding by calling their prepareForEmbedding method and returning an array of statuses

External Functions:
- none

Interaction Summary:
This file could potentially interact with other parts of the application by providing a way to write vectors to a file and prepare objects for embedding. It may also interact with the Pinecone class from '../pinecone/client' if used in conjunction with it.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the Pinecone class and how is it used in this file?
- How are vectors added, replaced, and cleared in AnswerSession?
- What is the format of the output file created by writeVectorsToFile?
- What is the prepareForEmbedding method and how is it used in prepareAllForEmbedding?
