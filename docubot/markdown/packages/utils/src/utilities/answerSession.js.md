Summary:
This file contains the implementation of the AnswerSession class which is responsible for managing a set of vectors and writing them to files. It also has a function to prepare objects for embedding.

Import statements:
The file imports the fs module which is a Node.js module for interacting with the file system. It also imports the Pinecone module from a local file.

Script Summary:
The AnswerSession class has several functions for managing vectors. The addVectors function adds vectors to the existing set of vectors. The replaceVectors function replaces the existing set of vectors with a new set. The clearVectors function clears the existing set of vectors. The writeVectorsToFile function writes the set of vectors to files. The prepareAllForEmbedding function prepares objects for embedding.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): Initializes the AnswerSession object with an empty vectors array and assigns the properties of the config object to the AnswerSession object.
- initPinecone(options): Initializes a Pinecone object with the given options and assigns it to the AnswerSession object.
- addVectors(vectors): Adds vectors to the existing set of vectors.
- replaceVectors(vectors): Replaces the existing set of vectors with a new set.
- clearVectors(): Clears the existing set of vectors.
- writeVectorsToFile(): Writes the set of vectors to files.
- prepareAllForEmbedding(objects): Prepares objects for embedding.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
The AnswerSession class can be used by other parts of the application to manage sets of vectors and prepare objects for embedding.

Developer Questions:
- What is the maximum file size for the output files?
- What is the format of the output files?
- How are objects prepared for embedding?

Known Issues and TODOs:
None.
