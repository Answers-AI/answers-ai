Summary:
This file defines a class called AnswerSession which contains methods for managing and manipulating session data. It includes functions for initializing a Pinecone client, adding and replacing vectors, clearing vectors, writing vectors to a file, and preparing objects for embedding.

Import statements:
- fs: a built-in Node.js module for working with the file system
- PineconeClient: a class from another module in the application for interacting with the Pinecone API

Script Summary:
- Defines a class called AnswerSession
- Includes methods for managing and manipulating session data
- Uses the fs module to write vectors to a file
- Uses the PineconeClient class to interact with the Pinecone API

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): initializes the AnswerSession object with a config object
- initPinecone(options): initializes a PineconeClient object with the provided options
- addVectors(vectors): adds vectors to the AnswerSession object's vectors array
- replaceVectors(vectors): replaces the AnswerSession object's vectors array with the provided vectors
- clearVectors(): clears the AnswerSession object's vectors array
- writeVectorsToFile(): writes the AnswerSession object's vectors to a file
- prepareAllForEmbedding(objects): prepares objects for embedding by calling their prepareForEmbedding() method

External Functions:
- N/A

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing methods for managing and manipulating session data. It may be used by other modules to store and retrieve session data, and to interact with the Pinecone API.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the config object passed to the constructor?
- What options can be passed to the initPinecone() method?
- What is the format of the objects passed to the prepareAllForEmbedding() method?
- What is the output format of the writeVectorsToFile() method?
- How is the AnswerSession object used in other parts of the application?
