Summary:
This file exports a class called AnswerSession that has methods for initializing a PineconeClient, adding, replacing, and clearing vectors, writing vectors to a file, and preparing objects for embedding.

Import statements:
The file imports the fs module for file system operations and a PineconeClient module from a local file.

Script Summary:
The AnswerSession class has methods for initializing a PineconeClient, adding, replacing, and clearing vectors, writing vectors to a file, and preparing objects for embedding.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): Initializes an instance of the AnswerSession class with an empty vectors array and assigns properties from the config object.
- initPinecone(options): Initializes a new PineconeClient instance with the provided options and assigns it to the AnswerSession instance's pinecone property.
- addVectors(vectors): Adds one or more vectors to the AnswerSession instance's vectors array.
- replaceVectors(vectors): Replaces the AnswerSession instance's vectors array with the provided array.
- clearVectors(): Clears the AnswerSession instance's vectors array.
- writeVectorsToFile(): Writes the AnswerSession instance's vectors array to a file. The vectors are split into multiple files if the total size exceeds 1.8MB.
- prepareAllForEmbedding(objects): Calls the prepareForEmbedding method on each object in the provided array and returns an array of statuses.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file does not interact with the larger application directly, but it provides functionality for storing and preparing data that could be used by other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the PineconeClient and how is it used?
- How are vectors split into multiple files in the writeVectorsToFile method?
- What is the prepareForEmbedding method and how does it work?

Known Issues and TODOs:
- None
