Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "es2021"],
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "allowJs": true,
    "isolatedModules": false
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "extends": "tsconfig/node.json",
  "include": ["src"],
  "types": ["node", "types"]
}

Summary:
This is a configuration file for a TypeScript application. It contains settings for the TypeScript compiler, such as the output directory and which libraries to include. It also specifies which files to exclude and include in the compilation process.

Service:
N/A

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file extends a base configuration file located at "tsconfig/node.json". It specifies the output directory as "./dist" and the root directory as "./src". It also allows JavaScript files to be included in the compilation process and disables isolated modules.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "compilerOptions": Specifies options for the TypeScript compiler
  - "lib": Specifies which libraries to include in the compilation process (in this case, the DOM and ES2021)
  - "outDir": Specifies the output directory for compiled files
  - "rootDir": Specifies the root directory for TypeScript source files
  - "allowJs": Allows JavaScript files to be included in the compilation process
  - "isolatedModules": Disables isolated modules
- "exclude": Specifies which files to exclude from the compilation process (in this case, the "node_modules" directory)
- "extends": Specifies a base configuration file to extend
- "include": Specifies which files to include in the compilation process (in this case, all files in the "src" directory)
- "types": Specifies which type definitions to include in the compilation process (in this case, the "node" and "types" type definitions)

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file affects how the TypeScript compiler compiles the application. It determines which files are included and excluded, where the compiled files are outputted, and which libraries and type definitions are included.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if I change the output directory?
- How do I add additional libraries to the compilation process?
- What is the purpose of the "isolatedModules" option?
- How do I exclude specific files or directories from the compilation process?
- What is the difference between "extends" and "include"?
