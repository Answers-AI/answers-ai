What is the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application?
A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that determine how a larger application behaves. It is used to customize the behavior of the application to suit specific needs. Configuration files are typically written in a specific format, such as JSON or YAML, and are read by the application at runtime.

File Contents:
The provided file is a JSON file that contains configuration settings for a specific package called "eslint-config-custom". It specifies the name, version, main file, license, dependencies, devDependencies, and publishConfig of the package.

Summary:
The configuration file specifies the settings and dependencies for the "eslint-config-custom" package.

Service:
The "eslint-config-custom" package is a custom configuration for the ESLint tool, which is used for linting JavaScript code.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file specifies the dependencies required for the "eslint-config-custom" package, including ESLint, eslint-config-next, eslint-config-prettier, eslint-plugin-react, and eslint-config-turbo. It also specifies the devDependency of TypeScript.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "name": specifies the name of the package
- "version": specifies the version of the package
- "main": specifies the main file of the package
- "license": specifies the license of the package
- "dependencies": specifies the dependencies required for the package
- "devDependencies": specifies the devDependencies required for the package
- "publishConfig": specifies the publish configuration for the package

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file specifies the dependencies required for the "eslint-config-custom" package, which will affect how the package behaves when used in an application. The devDependency of TypeScript will also affect how the package behaves during development.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "eslint-config-custom" package?
- What are the dependencies required for the package?
- How does the package interact with other parts of the application?
- How can I modify the configuration file to customize the package behavior?
- Are there any known issues or TODO items related to the configuration file?
