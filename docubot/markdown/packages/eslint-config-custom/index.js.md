Summary:
This file exports an object that extends the ESLint configuration with additional rules and plugins.

Import statements:
None.

Script Summary:
The module exports an object with three properties:
- `extends`: an array of strings that specify which base configurations to use. In this case, it extends the `next`, `turbo`, and `prettier` configurations.
- `rules`: an object that specifies additional rules to enable or disable. In this case, it disables three rules: `@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages`, `turbo/no-undeclared-env-vars`, and `react/jsx-key`.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used as an ESLint configuration for the application. It extends the base configurations provided by `next`, `turbo`, and `prettier`, and disables some rules that may not be relevant or desirable for the application.

Developer Questions:
- What other ESLint configurations are being used in the application?
- What are the specific rules being disabled and why?
- How can I add or modify rules in this configuration?
