Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```

Summary:
This file is a configuration file for a larger application. It specifies various settings for the TypeScript compiler, such as the target version of ECMAScript, the module system to use, and whether to enforce strict type checking. It also includes an `extends` property that references another configuration file, and an `exclude` property that specifies which files and directories should be excluded from compilation.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not specified in the file itself, but it is likely part of a larger TypeScript project.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets various options for the TypeScript compiler, including the target version of ECMAScript, the module system to use, and whether to enforce strict type checking. It also extends another configuration file and specifies which files and directories should be excluded from compilation.

Configuration Breakdown:
- `compilerOptions`: An object that specifies various options for the TypeScript compiler, including:
  - `lib`: An array of library files to include in the compilation process. In this case, only `es2021` is included.
  - `module`: The module system to use. In this case, `ES2020` is used.
  - `target`: The target version of ECMAScript to compile to. In this case, `es2021` is targeted.
  - `strict`: Whether to enable strict type checking. In this case, it is enabled.
  - `esModuleInterop`: Whether to enable interoperability between CommonJS and ES6 modules. In this case, it is enabled.
  - `skipLibCheck`: Whether to skip type checking of declaration files. In this case, it is enabled.
  - `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`: Whether to enforce consistent casing in file names. In this case, it is enabled.
  - `moduleResolution`: The module resolution strategy to use. In this case, `node` is used.
  - `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Whether to allow default imports from modules with no default export. In this case, it is enabled.
- `extends`: A path to another configuration file that this file extends.
- `exclude`: An array of file and directory names to exclude from compilation.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the rest of the application by specifying how TypeScript should compile the code. It affects the resulting JavaScript code that is generated, as well as the type checking that is performed during compilation.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the `extends` property, and what does it reference?
- What is the significance of the `exclude` property, and how does it affect the compilation process?
- What happens if I change the `target` property to a different version of ECMAScript?
- How does the `strict` property affect the type checking process?
- What is the difference between `esModuleInterop` and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`? When should I use each one?
- Are there any other configuration files that this file depends on or that depend on this file?
- How can I test changes to this configuration file to ensure that they don't break the application?
- Are there any known issues or limitations with this configuration file that I should be aware of?
- Are there any TODO items related to this configuration file that need to be addressed?
