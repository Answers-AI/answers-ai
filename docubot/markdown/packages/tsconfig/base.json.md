What is the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application?
A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that define how a larger application should behave. These settings can include things like database connection strings, API keys, and other application-specific settings. Configuration files are typically used to make it easier to manage and deploy applications, as they allow developers to change settings without having to modify the application code itself.

File Contents:
This file is a JSON file that contains configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler. It includes settings for things like module resolution, strict type checking, and whether or not to generate declaration files.

Summary:
This file contains configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler.

Service:
This configuration file is specific to the TypeScript compiler.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets up the TypeScript compiler with strict type checking and generates declaration files.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "$schema": The schema for the JSON file.
- "display": The display name for the configuration.
- "compilerOptions": The options for the TypeScript compiler.
- "composite": Whether or not to enable composite projects.
- "declaration": Whether or not to generate declaration files.
- "declarationMap": Whether or not to generate source maps for declaration files.
- "esModuleInterop": Whether or not to enable ES module interop.
- "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": Whether or not to enforce consistent casing in file names.
- "inlineSources": Whether or not to inline source maps in the generated JavaScript files.
- "isolatedModules": Whether or not to enable isolated modules.
- "moduleResolution": The module resolution strategy to use.
- "noUnusedLocals": Whether or not to report unused local variables.
- "noUnusedParameters": Whether or not to report unused parameters.
- "preserveWatchOutput": Whether or not to preserve the output of the watch mode.
- "skipLibCheck": Whether or not to skip type checking of library files.
- "strict": Whether or not to enable strict type checking.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file sets up the TypeScript compiler to enforce strict type checking and generate declaration files. This could potentially impact the rest of the application, as it may cause errors to be reported that were previously not caught.
