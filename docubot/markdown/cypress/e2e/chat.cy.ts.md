Summary:
This file contains two test cases for the homepage of an AI chat application. The first test case checks if the user can visit the homepage and chat with the AI. The second test case checks if the user can create a new chat from an existing chat.

Import statements:

Script Summary:
The file contains two test cases that check the functionality of the homepage of an AI chat application. The test cases use Cypress, a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework, to simulate user interactions with the application.

Internal Functions:
The file does not contain any internal functions.

External Functions:
The file uses the following Cypress functions:
- describe(): A function that defines a test suite.
- beforeEach(): A function that runs before each test case in a test suite.
- it(): A function that defines a test case.
- cy.login(): A custom command that logs the user into the application.
- cy.intercept(): A function that intercepts HTTP requests and responses.
- cy.visit(): A function that visits a URL.
- cy.get(): A function that gets a DOM element.

- should(): A function that asserts a condition.

Interaction Summary:
The file interacts with the homepage of an AI chat application. The test cases simulate user interactions with the application, such as typing messages into the chat input and clicking buttons.

Developer Questions:
- What other test cases should be added to ensure full coverage of the homepage functionality?
- Are there any edge cases that should be tested?
- How can the test cases be optimized for faster execution?
- How can the custom command cy.login() be modified to accept parameters for different user credentials?

Known Issues and TODOs:
There are no known issues or bugs with the component. One possible TODO item is to add more test cases to ensure full coverage of the homepage functionality.
