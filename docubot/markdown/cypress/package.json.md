Purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application:

A configuration file is a file that contains settings and parameters that determine how a larger application behaves. It is used to customize the behavior of the application without changing the code. Configuration files are typically used to store settings that are specific to a particular environment or deployment, such as development, testing, or production.

The provided file is a package.json file, which is a configuration file used by Node.js-based applications. It contains metadata about the application, such as its name, version, and dependencies. It also includes scripts that can be run to perform various tasks, such as running tests.

The file relates to the application by specifying the dependencies required by the application, as well as scripts that can be used to run tests. The dependencies listed in the file are installed when the application is installed, ensuring that all required packages are available.

Common questions that developers working in this code base may have with regards to this file:
