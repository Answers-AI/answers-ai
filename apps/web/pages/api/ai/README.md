# getDomainList.ts

This file contains a JavaScript function that is used to retrieve a list of domains from a server. It uses the Next.js API to make a request and returns an array of domains. The function also handles authentication, using the NextAuth library to ensure that only authorized users can access the list. The output is a JSON object containing the list of domains.

# getUrlList.ts

This JavaScript file provides a function to retrieve a list of URLs from a given set of domains. It is designed to be used in a Next.js application with authentication enabled.

## Functionality

The `getUrlList` function takes an optional `domains` parameter, which is an array of strings representing the domains to search. It then returns an array of objects containing the URLs found in the given domains.

The function also handles authentication, using the `getServerSession` function from the `next-auth` library. If the user is not authenticated, the function will return a 401 status code.

## Usage

To use the `getUrlList` function, import it into your Next.js application and call it with the desired parameters. The function will return an array of objects containing the URLs found in the given domains.

```js
import { getUrlList } from '@ui/chat/getUrlList';

const params = { domains: ['example.com', 'example.org'] };
const urls = await getUrlList(params);
```
# ai/prompt.ts

This file contains the code necessary to handle requests to the OpenAI API. It imports the necessary modules, defines the data type, initializes the OpenAI API, and defines the handler function. The handler function is responsible for handling requests, fetching the context, and returning the response. 

This code is intended for use by senior level JavaScript developers who need to interact with the OpenAI API. It provides a concise and efficient way to handle requests and responses, and is designed to be easily integrated into existing projects.

# ai/query.ts

This file contains the code for handling queries from users in a chatbot application. It is responsible for handling the request, validating the user, fetching the context, and returning a response.

## Features

- Handles requests from users in a chatbot application
- Validates the user
- Fetches the context
- Returns a response
- Utilizes NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse
- Implements getServerSession from next-auth
- Imports Message from types
- Imports prisma from db/dist
- Imports cors from @ui/cors
- Imports inngest from @utils/ingest/client
- Imports authOptions from @ui/authOptions
- Imports createChatChain from @utils/llm/chains
- Imports upsertChat from @ui/chat/upsertChat
- Imports fetchContext from @utils/pinecone/fetchContext

## Usage

To use this file, import it into your project and call the handler function with a NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse. The handler will handle the request, validate the user, fetch the context, and return a response.

# README

This file contains the JavaScript code for an OpenAI API integration. It provides a handler function that can be used to create a completion based on a given prompt. The handler function initializes the OpenAI API and then calls the `createCompletion` method to generate a completion based on the given prompt. The handler also calls the `fetchContext` method to get additional data from the Pinecone API.

The code is designed to be used in a Next.js application, and it uses the `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` types from the Next.js API. It also imports the `Configuration` and `OpenAIApi` classes from the OpenAI library, as well as the `cors` function from the UI library.

The code is designed to be used in a server-side environment, and it is not intended to be used in a client-side application. It is important to note that the code requires an OpenAI API key to be set in the environment variables.

# OpenAI Stream

This file contains the code for a JavaScript handler that enables the use of OpenAI Stream for natural language processing. It is designed to be used with the OpenAI API and provides a way to stream natural language processing results in real-time.

The code includes a configuration object that sets the runtime environment to 'edge'. It also includes a handler function that takes a Request object as an argument and returns a Response object. The handler function contains logic to handle both OPTIONS and POST requests. It also contains logic to fetch data from the OpenAI API and process it using the OpenAI Stream. Finally, it returns a Response object with the stream data.

The code also includes types for the AnswersFilters, Message, and Request objects. These types provide a way to define the data that is expected to be passed to the handler function.

This code is designed for senior level JavaScript developers who are familiar with the OpenAI API and Stream. It provides a way to stream natural language processing results in real-time and is an essential part of any project that requires natural language processing.
