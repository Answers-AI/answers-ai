This page is responsible for rendering the Chat component for a given chatId. It imports the Chat component from the Chat directory and passes the chatId as a parameter. The page also exports a metadata object which contains the title and description of the page.

The page is written in TypeScript and uses React for rendering. It is also set up to revalidate every minute.
