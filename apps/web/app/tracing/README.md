# Tracing | Answers AI

This page.tsx file contains the code for the Tracing page of the Answers AI application. It is responsible for rendering the page and displaying the DB Studio interface.

The code imports React and defines the page metadata. It then creates a functional component called DB_STUDIO which renders the page and displays the DB Studio interface. The interface is rendered using an iframe, and the URL is set using the environment variable DB_STUDIO_SERVER_URL. If the variable is not set, the default URL of http://localhost:4173/ is used.

Finally, the component is exported as the default export.
