# DB Studio

This page.tsx file contains the code for the DB Studio page, which is used to access the Answers AI database. It imports the React library and defines the metadata for the page. It also defines the DB_STUDIO_SERVER_URL variable, which is used to set the URL of the server. Finally, it defines the DB_STUDIO function, which renders an iframe with the server URL. This allows developers to access the Answers AI database from the page.
