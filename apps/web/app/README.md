# Chat.tsx

This file contains the code for a React component that provides a chat interface for users. It is responsible for handling authentication, retrieving data from the database, and displaying the chat interface.

## Features

- Authentication: Uses `next-auth` to authenticate users and retrieve their session data.
- Database: Uses `prisma` to retrieve data from the database, including prompts, chats, and journeys.
- Chat Interface: Uses the `AnswersProvider` component to display the chat interface, including prompts, messages, and user information.
- Developer Tools: Includes the `DeveloperTools` component to provide additional debugging and development features.

## Usage

The `Chat` component takes two optional parameters: `chatId` and `journeyId`. If `chatId` is provided, the component will retrieve the corresponding chat from the database. If `journeyId` is provided, the component will retrieve the corresponding journey from the database.

The component will then render the `AnswersProvider` component, which will display the chat interface. The `DeveloperTools` component will also be rendered, providing additional debugging and development features.

# README.js

README.js is a JavaScript script that automatically generates a README.md file for a given folder. It scans the folder for files with the extensions `.ts`, `.js`, and `.tsx`, and uses an API endpoint to generate a README.md file based on the contents of the files.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- axios

## Usage

To use README.js, simply run the script in the root directory of the folder you wish to generate a README.md file for. The script will automatically create a README.md file in the folder if it doesn't already exist, and will append the generated README.md content to the existing file if it does.

## API Endpoint

The API endpoint used by README.js is `http://localhost:3000/api/ai/readme`. It takes a `POST` request with the following data:

- `file_path`: The path of the file being processed
- `file_contents`: The contents of the file being processed
- `readme_contents`: The contents of the existing README.md file (if any)

The endpoint will return a JSON response containing the generated README.md content for the file.
