# README for api/chats/readme.js

This file is responsible for generating a README.md file for each folder in the project. It uses the `fs` module to read and write files, the `path` module to get the file path, and the `axios` module to make an API call to the `BASE_URL` endpoint.

The code loops through each file in the folder and checks if it is a file or a directory. If it is a file, it checks if the file extension is `.ts`, `.js`, or `.tsx` and then makes an API call to the `BASE_URL` endpoint, passing in the contents of the file in the request. The response is then written to the README.md file. If it is a directory, it recursively calls the `processFolder` function to process the subdirectories.

The ultimate goal of this code is to generate comprehensive documentation that will enable other developers to understand the code and use it effectively in their own projects.

# api/chats/route.ts
This file contains the code for the API routes for the chat feature. It includes two functions: GET and DELETE. 

## GET
The GET function is used to retrieve all chat records associated with the current user. It first checks for a valid user session, then queries the database for all chat records associated with the user's email address. Finally, it returns the records as a JSON response.

## DELETE
The DELETE function is used to delete a specific chat record. It first checks for a valid user session, then queries the database for the chat record associated with the user's email address and the specified ID. If the record is found, it is deleted and a JSON response is returned.
