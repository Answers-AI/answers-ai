# Jira App Sync Route
This route is responsible for syncing the Jira app with the server. It is used to send data from the app to the server, including user information and filters.

## Imports
This route imports the following modules:
* `getAppSettings` from `@ui/getAppSettings`
* `getServerSession` from `next-auth`
* `authOptions` from `@ui/authOptions`
* `inngest` from `@utils/ingest/client`

## Functionality
The `POST` function is responsible for sending data from the app to the server. It first retrieves the app settings and the user session, then it parses the request body for filters. Finally, it sends the data to the server using the `inngest` module.
