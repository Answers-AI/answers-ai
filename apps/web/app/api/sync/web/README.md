# api/sync/web/route.ts
This file contains the code for a POST request handler for the `/api/sync/web/route` endpoint. It is responsible for ingesting a list of URLs and app settings to the server.

## Parameters
- `url`: A single URL string
- `urls`: An array of URL strings
- `byDomain`: A boolean value indicating whether the URLs should be grouped by domain

## Functionality
The POST request handler will first retrieve the app settings and the server session. It will then parse the request body for the `url` and `urls` parameters. It will then use the `getUniqueUrls` utility to filter out any duplicate URLs. Finally, it will send the data to the server for ingestion.

## Output
The output of the POST request handler is a JSON response with a `status` property set to `ok`.
