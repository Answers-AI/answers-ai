# api/sync/openapi/route.ts
This file contains the code for a POST request to the OpenAPI endpoint. It is responsible for sending the app settings and user information to the OpenAPI endpoint.

## Dependencies
This code requires the following dependencies:
- `@ui/getAppSettings`
- `next-auth`
- `@ui/authOptions`
- `@utils/ingest/client`

## Functionality
The POST request is responsible for sending the app settings and user information to the OpenAPI endpoint. It does this by first retrieving the app settings using `getAppSettings()` and then retrieving the user session using `getServerSession()`. The user information is then used to create an object containing the app settings and the user information, which is then sent to the OpenAPI endpoint using `inngest.send()`.
