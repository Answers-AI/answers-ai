# Slack App Sync Route
This file contains the code for the POST route for syncing the Slack app with the server. It is responsible for retrieving the app settings and the user session, and then sending the data to the ingest server.

## Imports
The following imports are used in this file:
- `getAppSettings` from `@ui/getAppSettings`
- `getServerSession` from `next-auth`
- `authOptions` from `@ui/authOptions`
- `inngest` from `@utils/ingest/client`

## POST Route
The POST route is responsible for retrieving the app settings and the user session, and then sending the data to the ingest server. It does this by using the imported functions to get the app settings and the user session, and then sending the data to the ingest server using the `inngest.send()` function. The data sent includes the version, timestamp, name, user, and the app settings.
