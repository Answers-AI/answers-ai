Filepath: apps/web-extension/src/useStreamedResponse.ts
Overview: Summary:
This file contains a custom React hook called `useStreamedResponse` which is used to generate responses from an API endpoint in a streaming fashion. It takes in answers and a function to add answers as parameters and returns isLoading, generatedResponse, and generateResponse.

Import statements:
The file imports the `useState` hook from the `react` library.

Script Summary:
The `useStreamedResponse` hook takes in `answers` and `addAnswer` as parameters. It then initializes two state variables, `isLoading` and `generatedResponse`, using the `useState` hook. The `generateResponse` function is defined which takes in a prompt and filters as parameters. It then makes a POST request to an API endpoint using `fetch` and sends the prompt, answers, and filters in the request body. If the response is not okay, an error is thrown. If the response contains data, it is read in a streaming fashion using a `TextDecoder` and `ReadableStream`. The response is split into chunks and parsed for JSON data. The `generatedResponse` state variable is updated with the current answer and any extra data parsed from the response. Finally, the `addAnswer` function is called with the answer and extra data, and the `isLoading` state variable is set to false.

Internal Functions:
- `generateResponse`: This function takes in a prompt and filters as parameters and generates a response from an API endpoint in a streaming fashion. It updates the `generatedResponse` and `isLoading` state variables and calls the `addAnswer` function with the answer and extra data.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger web extension application and is used to generate responses from an API endpoint in a streaming fashion. It interacts with other components in the application by providing a custom hook that can be used to generate responses.

Developer Questions:
- What is the API endpoint being used and what are the expected response formats?
- What is the `answers` parameter used for and how is it generated?
- What is the `addAnswer` function used for and how is it implemented?
- How is the `generatedResponse` state variable used in other components?
- How can the `generateResponse` function be customized to handle different response formats or endpoints?
