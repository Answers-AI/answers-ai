Filepath: apps/web-extension/src/useAI.ts
Overview: Summary:
This file contains a custom hook called useAI that utilizes the useQuery hook from the @tanstack/react-query library and axios to make API calls to a third-party AI service. It also imports another custom hook called useStreamedResponse. Additionally, the file exports a function called syncAi that also uses axios to make an API call.

Import statements:
- useQuery from '@tanstack/react-query': a hook for fetching and caching data from an API
- axios: a library for making HTTP requests
- useState, useCallback from 'react': hooks for managing state in functional components
- useStreamedResponse from './useStreamedResponse': a custom hook for managing streamed responses from the AI service

Script Summary:
The useAI hook manages state related to the AI service, including the user's prompt, the AI's generated response, and any filters applied to the response. It also uses the useQuery hook to fetch data from the AI service and the useStreamedResponse hook to manage streamed responses.

The syncAi function is used to synchronize the AI service with the application.

Internal Functions:
- useAI: a custom hook that manages state related to the AI service and uses the useQuery and useStreamedResponse hooks to fetch and manage data from the AI service. Returns an object with various state variables and functions.
- addAnswer: a function that takes an answer and adds it to the list of answers in state.
- onSuccess: a function that is called when the useQuery hook successfully fetches data from the AI service. If there are any answers in state, it calls the addAnswer function with the fetched data.

External Functions:
- syncAi: a function that synchronizes the AI service with the application by making an API call to the AI service.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing a custom hook that manages state related to the AI service and by exporting a function that synchronizes the AI service with the application. It also uses the useQuery hook from the @tanstack/react-query library to fetch data from the AI service.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the data returned by the AI service?
- How does the useStreamedResponse hook manage streamed responses?
- What is the purpose of the syncAi function and when should it be called?
- How does the useAI hook interact with other components in the application?
