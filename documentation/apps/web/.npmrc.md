Filepath: apps/web/.npmrc
Overview: Summary:
This file is a configuration file for the npm package manager. It contains settings that affect how npm installs and manages packages.

Dependencies:
This file does not have any dependencies.

Code Summary:
The code in this file sets several configuration options for npm. The first option, "auto-install-peers", tells npm to automatically install any peer dependencies that are required by a package. The second option, "link-workspace-packages", tells npm to link packages in a workspace together. The third option, "save-workspace-protocol", specifies how npm should save packages in a workspace. Finally, the "public-hoist-pattern" options tell npm which packages should be hoisted to the top level of the workspace.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by affecting how npm installs and manages packages. The "auto-install-peers" option, for example, could cause npm to install additional packages that are required by a package. The "link-workspace-packages" option could cause npm to link packages together in a workspace, which could affect how the application is built and run. The "public-hoist-pattern" options could affect which packages are available to other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- How do the "auto-install-peers" and "public-hoist-pattern" options affect the application's dependencies?
- What is the "deep" package that is linked in the "link-workspace-packages" option?
- How does the "save-workspace-protocol" option affect how packages are saved in a workspace?
- What happens if a package has conflicting peer dependencies with another package in the workspace?
