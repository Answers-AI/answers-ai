Overview: API Summary:
This file contains two API endpoints for getting and updating app settings.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` from `next/server`: used for returning responses to the client.
- `getServerSession` from `next-auth`: used for getting the user session.
- `deepmerge` from `@utils/deepmerge`: used for merging the existing app settings with the new app settings.
- `prisma` from `db/dist`: used for database operations.
- `authOptions` from `@ui/authOptions`: used for authentication options.
- `getAppSettings` from `@ui/getAppSettings`: used for getting the app settings.

Internal Functions:
- `GET(req: Request, res: Response)`: handles the GET request for getting the app settings. It calls the `getAppSettings` function and returns the app settings as a JSON response.
- `POST(request: Request)`: handles the POST request for updating the app settings. It first gets the user session using `getServerSession`. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects to the authentication page. It then gets the user from the database using the email from the session. It merges the existing app settings with the new app settings using `deepmerge`. It then updates the user's app settings in the database using `prisma`. It returns the updated app settings as a JSON response.

External Services:
- Database: This file interacts with the database using `prisma` for getting and updating the user's app settings.

API Endpoints:
- GET /api/settings
Summary: Returns the app settings.
Example Usage:
```
const response = await fetch('/api/settings');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```
Example Response:
```
{
  "setting1": "value1",
  "setting2": "value2"
}
```

- POST /api/settings
Summary: Updates the app settings.
Example Usage:
```
const response = await fetch('/api/settings', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    setting1: 'new value'
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```
Example Response:
```
{
  "setting1": "new value",
  "setting2": "value2"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can use the GET endpoint to get the app settings and use them in the application. They can use the POST endpoint to update the app settings based on user preferences or other factors.

Developer Questions:
- How are the app settings used in the application?
- How is the user authenticated in this file?
- How can I add validation for user access to update app settings?
- Why is the code for updating organization app settings commented out?
