Filepath: apps/web/.gitignore
Overview: Summary:
This file is a .gitignore file located in the apps/web directory of the application. It is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git when committing changes to the repository.

Dependencies:
This file does not have any dependencies.

Code Summary:
The code in this file specifies two items to be ignored by Git: the node_modules directory and the .env file. The node_modules directory contains all of the dependencies for the application, and can be very large. The .env file contains environment variables that should not be committed to version control.

Interaction Summary:
This file does not directly interact with the rest of the application, but it is important for the proper functioning of Git. By ignoring the node_modules directory and the .env file, developers can avoid committing unnecessary files to the repository and keep sensitive information secure.

Developer Questions:
- What other files or directories should be ignored by Git?
- How can I add additional files or directories to the .gitignore file?
- What happens if I accidentally commit a file that should have been ignored?
