Overview: API Summary:
This API endpoint retrieves a list of URLs based on the domains provided.

Import statements:
- NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse from 'next': These are types from the Next.js framework for handling API requests and responses.
- getServerSession from 'next-auth': This is a function from the Next.js authentication library for retrieving the user session from the server.
- cors from '@ui/cors': This is a middleware function for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the API endpoint.
- authOptions from '@ui/authOptions': This is an object containing options for the Next.js authentication library.
- getUrlList from '@ui/chat/getUrlList': This is a function for retrieving a list of URLs based on the domains provided.

Internal Functions:
- handler: This is the main function for the API endpoint. It takes in a NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse as parameters and returns a Promise. It first enables CORS on the response, then retrieves the user session from the server using the getServerSession function. If the user is not authenticated, it returns a 401 status code. Otherwise, it retrieves the domains from the request body and passes them to the getUrlList function to retrieve a list of URLs. Finally, it returns the list of URLs in the response.

External Services:
- Next.js authentication library
- '@ui/cors' middleware function
- '@ui/chat/getUrlList' function
