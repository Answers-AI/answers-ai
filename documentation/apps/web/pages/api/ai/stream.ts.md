Overview: API Summary:
This file exports a single API endpoint that handles a POST request to `/api/ai/stream`. The endpoint takes in a JSON payload containing a prompt string, an array of messages, and filters for OpenAI's GPT-3 model. It then sends a POST request to `/api/ai/prompt` with the payload, retrieves a response, and uses the response to create a stream of text generated by GPT-3. The stream is returned as a response to the original request.

Import statements:
- `OpenAIStream` from `@utils/OpenAIStream`: a custom utility function that creates a stream of text generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
- `cors` from `@ui/corsEdge`: a custom middleware function that handles CORS headers for Edge functions.
- `AnswersFilters` and `Message` from `types`: custom types used in the payload of the API endpoint.
- `getCompletionRequest` from `@utils/llm/getCompletionRequest`: a custom utility function that creates a completion request object for GPT-3.

Internal Functions:
- `handler`: the main function that handles the API endpoint. It takes in a `Request` object and returns a `Response` object. It first checks if the request method is `OPTIONS` and returns a CORS response if it is. It then retrieves the payload from the request body and sends a POST request to `/api/ai/prompt` with the payload. It uses the response to create a stream of text using `OpenAIStream` and returns the stream as a response. If there is an error, it creates a default payload and uses it to create a stream of text.

External Services:
- `/api/ai/prompt`: an API endpoint that takes in a JSON payload containing a prompt string, an array of messages, and filters for OpenAI's GPT-3 model. It returns a JSON object containing `pineconeData`, `context`, and `summary` properties.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/ai/stream
Summary: Handles a POST request to `/api/ai/stream` by retrieving a payload from the request body, sending a POST request to `/api/ai/prompt` with the payload, creating a stream of text using `OpenAIStream`, and returning the stream as a response.
Example Usage:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/stream', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ filters, messages, prompt })
});
const stream = await response.text();
```

Example Response:
```
This is a stream of text generated by GPT-3.
```

Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can use the `/api/ai/stream` endpoint to generate a stream of text based on a prompt and an array of messages. The stream can be used to display a conversation or to generate text in real-time. Developers can customize the GPT-3 model and the stream parameters by modifying the payload sent to the endpoint. They can also modify the default payload used in case of an error. When debugging or changing this file, developers may have questions about the `OpenAIStream` utility function, the `getCompletionRequest` utility function, and the `cors` middleware function. They may also need to understand the structure of the payload and the response objects used in this file.
