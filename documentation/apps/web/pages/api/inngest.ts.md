Overview: API Summary:
This file exports an API endpoint for the Inngest service, which is a client for sending and receiving events. It includes functions for handling events related to Algolia, authentication, Confluence, embeddings, messages, OpenAPI, prompts, Slack, web, and Jira.

Import statements:
- `Inngest` from the `inngest` package: A client for sending and receiving events.
- `serve` from the `inngest/next` package: A function for serving the Inngest client as a Next.js API route.
- `createInngestFunctions` from the `@utils/ingest/EventVersionHandler` module: A function for creating Inngest functions from an array of event handlers.
- Various functions from the `@utils/ingest` module: Functions for handling events related to Algolia, authentication, Confluence, embeddings, messages, OpenAPI, prompts, Slack, web, and Jira.

Internal Functions:
- `handlers`: An object containing all of the event handler functions imported from the `@utils/ingest` module.
- `functions`: An array of all the event handler functions from `handlers`.
- `inngest`: An instance of the `Inngest` client with the name "My App".
- `inngestFunctions`: An object containing Inngest functions created from the event handler functions.
- `serve(inngest, inngestFunctions, { signingKey: process.env.INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY })`: A function that serves the Inngest client as a Next.js API route, using the `inngest` client and `inngestFunctions` as handlers. The `signingKey` option is set to the value of the `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable.

External Services:
This file does not interact with any external services.

API Endpoints:
This file exports a single API endpoint:

POST /api/inngest
Summary: Receives and handles Inngest events.
Example Usage:
```jsx
const response = await fetch('/api/inngest', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(event),
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const data = await response.json();
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Interaction Summary:
Client-side components can send Inngest events to this API endpoint using a POST request with a JSON payload. The endpoint will handle the event using the appropriate event handler function, as defined in the `handlers` object. The response will be a JSON object with a `success` property indicating whether the event was successfully handled.

Developer Questions:
- What events are handled by each of the event handler functions imported from `@utils/ingest`?
- How can I add a new event handler function to this API endpoint?
- How can I modify the behavior of the Inngest client or the Inngest functions used by this API endpoint?
