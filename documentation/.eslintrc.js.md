Filepath: .eslintrc.js
Overview: Summary:
This file is an ESLint configuration file that sets up linting rules for the project. It extends the "custom" configuration and sets the root directory for the Next.js application.

Import statements:
None

Script Summary:
The module exports an object with three properties: root, extends, and settings. The root property is set to true, which tells ESLint to stop looking for configuration files in parent directories. The extends property loads the "custom" configuration, which is defined in another file. The settings property is an object that sets the root directory for the Next.js application.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by setting up linting rules for the project. It extends the "custom" configuration, which could potentially interact with other configuration files in the project. The settings property sets the root directory for the Next.js application, which could affect how the application is built and deployed.

Developer Questions:
- What is the "custom" configuration and where is it defined?
- How does changing the root directory affect the application?
- Are there any other ESLint configuration files in the project that could conflict with this one?
