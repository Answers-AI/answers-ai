Filepath: turbo.json
Overview: Summary:
This is a configuration file named "turbo.json" that is used in a larger application. It contains settings for global dependencies and environment variables, as well as a pipeline of tasks for building and deploying the application.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not specified.

- "pipeline": an object that defines a pipeline of tasks for building and deploying the application
  - "//#dev-docker": a comment that is used to disable a task in the pipeline
  - "//#dev-inngest": a comment that is used to disable a task in the pipeline
  - "//#dev-langchain": a comment that is used to disable a task in the pipeline
  - "//#db:healthcheck": a comment that is used to disable a task in the pipeline
  - "build": a task that builds the application
    - "outputMode": specifies the output mode for the task
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "db:generate": a task that generates a database
    - "cache": specifies whether to cache the task
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "db:migrate": a task that migrates a database
    - "cache": specifies whether to cache the task
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "db:deploy": a task that deploys a database
    - "cache": specifies whether to cache the task
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "db#build": a task that builds a database
    - "outputMode": specifies the output mode for the task
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "db#dev": a task that runs a development database
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "cache": specifies whether to cache the task
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "web#build": a task that builds the web application
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "lint": a task that lints the code
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task
  - "start": a task that starts the application
    - "dependsOn": an array of tasks that this task depends on
    - "outputs": an array of output files for the task

    - "persistent": specifies whether to keep the task running
    - "cache": specifies whether to cache the task

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file defines a pipeline of tasks for building and deploying the application. The settings in this file could interact with other parts of the application by specifying dependencies and outputs for each task.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the global dependencies and environment variables?
- How do I add or modify tasks in the pipeline?
- What is the difference between the "build" and "web#build" tasks?
- How do I disable a task in the pipeline?
- What is the purpose of the "persistent" option in the "dev" task?
