Filepath: packages/types/tsconfig.json
Overview: Summary:
This is a TypeScript configuration file that specifies the compiler options, excludes certain files, extends a base configuration file, and includes certain files.

Service:
There is no specific service mentioned in this configuration file.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets the compiler options to use ES2015, CommonJS module, output directory to "./dist", source directory to "./src", and source maps to true. It also excludes the "node_modules" directory and includes only the files in the "src" directory. Additionally, it extends a base configuration file.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "compilerOptions": specifies the compiler options for TypeScript
  - "lib": specifies the library files to be included in the compilation process. In this case, only ES2015 is included.
  - "module": specifies the module system to be used in the compiled code. In this case, CommonJS is used.
  - "outDir": specifies the output directory for the compiled code. In this case, it is set to "./dist".
  - "rootDir": specifies the root directory of the source code. In this case, it is set to "./src".
  - "sourceMap": specifies whether to generate source maps for the compiled code. In this case, it is set to true.
- "exclude": specifies the files or directories to be excluded from the compilation process. In this case, only the "node_modules" directory is excluded.
- "extends": specifies the base configuration file to be extended.
- "include": specifies the files or directories to be included in the compilation process. In this case, only the files in the "src" directory are included.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file sets the compiler options and includes/excludes certain files for the TypeScript compilation process. It may interact with other configuration files or code files that depend on the compiled code.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the base configuration file that this file extends?
- What other configuration files or code files depend on the compiled code?
- What happens if a file outside of the "src" directory is needed for the compilation process?
- How can I change the compiler options to use a different module system or library files?
