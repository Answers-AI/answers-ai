Filepath: packages/tsconfig/node.json
Overview: Summary:
This configuration file sets the compiler options for TypeScript in a Node.js environment and extends a base configuration file while excluding the node_modules directory.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not specified.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets the compiler options for TypeScript in a Node.js environment, extends a base configuration file, and excludes the node_modules directory.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "compilerOptions": This object sets the compiler options for TypeScript in a Node.js environment.
  - "lib": This array specifies the library files to be included in the compilation.
  - "module": This string specifies the module code generation for the compilation.
  - "target": This string specifies the ECMAScript target version for the compilation.
  - "strict": This boolean enables all strict type-checking options.
  - "esModuleInterop": This boolean enables emit interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules via creation of namespace objects for all imports.
  - "skipLibCheck": This boolean skips type checking of declaration files.
  - "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": This boolean ensures that casing is consistent in file names.
  - "moduleResolution": This string specifies the module resolution strategy.
  - "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": This boolean allows default imports from modules with no default export.
- "extends": This string specifies the path to the base configuration file to extend.
- "exclude": This array specifies the directories to exclude from compilation.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file sets the compiler options for TypeScript in a Node.js environment and extends a base configuration file. It could interact with the rest of the application by affecting the way TypeScript is compiled and how modules are resolved.

Developer Questions:
- What is the base configuration file that this configuration file extends?
- Why is the node_modules directory excluded from compilation?
- How does changing the "target" option affect the compiled code?
- What is the difference between "esModuleInterop" and "allowSyntheticDefaultImports"?
