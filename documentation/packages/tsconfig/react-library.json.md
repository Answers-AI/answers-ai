Developer Questions:
- What is the base configuration file that this file extends?
- What is the difference between the "ES2015" and "ESNext" library options?
- How does the "jsx" option affect how JSX is compiled?
- How does the "module" option affect how the library is packaged and imported?
- What is the minimum ECMAScript version required for the library to work properly?
