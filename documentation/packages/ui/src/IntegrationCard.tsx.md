Import statements:
- React, Component, ElementType from 'react'
- NextLink from 'next/link'

Component:
IntegrationCard: A functional component that takes in IntegrationCardProps and displays information about an integration.

Hooks:
- useState: Used to manage the state of lastInteraction.
- useFlags: Used to access feature flags from Flagsmith.
- useAnswers: Used to access the deletePrompt and updatePrompt functions from the AnswersContext.

Event Handlers:
- handleAuthIntegration: Handles the authentication process for the integration by calling the signIn function with the providerId and a callback URL.

Rendered components:
- Card: The main container for the IntegrationCard component.
- Box: A container for the card content.
- Wrapper: A conditional component that renders either a Box or a CardActionArea, depending on whether the card is expanded or not.

- Typography: Displays the integration's name and description.

Interaction Summary:
The IntegrationCard component can interact with the rest of the application through the onClick prop, which can be passed down from a parent component. It also interacts with the AnswersContext to access deletePrompt and updatePrompt functions, and with Flagsmith to access feature flags.

Developer Questions:
- What are the possible values for the lastInteraction state, and how are they used in the component?
- How does the expanded prop affect the rendering of the IntegrationCard component?
- How does the editable prop affect the rendering of the IntegrationSetting component?
- How does the IntegrationCard component handle authentication for different providers?
- How do the deletePrompt and updatePrompt functions from the AnswersContext affect the component's behavior?
