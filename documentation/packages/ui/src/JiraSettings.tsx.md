Import statements:
- Box, FormControl, FormLabel, FormGroup, FormControlLabel, Checkbox, Button, Typography, Paper, LinearProgress from '@mui/material': imports Material-UI components for building the form

Component:
- JiraSettings: a React component that displays a form for editing Jira settings. It takes in two props: appSettings (an object containing the current Jira settings) and editable (a boolean indicating whether the form is editable or read-only). It renders a Material-UI form with checkboxes for enabling/disabling Jira projects and autocomplete select inputs for setting default filters. It also includes buttons for saving changes and discarding changes.

Hooks:
- useState: used to manage component state for filters and localSettings
- useEffect: used to update localSettings when appSettings changes
- useAppSettings: a custom hook for managing app settings. It returns isLoading (a boolean indicating whether the app settings are currently being loaded) and updateAppSettings (a function for updating the app settings)

Event Handlers:
- handleSave: a function that updates the app settings with the current localSettings and filters
- handleEnableProject: a function that toggles the enabled status of a Jira project
- handleToggleAll: a function that toggles the enabled status of all Jira projects

Rendered components:
- LinearProgress: a Material-UI component that displays a loading bar when isLoading is true
- FormControl: a Material-UI component that groups form controls together
- FormLabel: a Material-UI component that displays a label for a form control
- FormGroup: a Material-UI component that groups form controls together horizontally
- FormControlLabel: a Material-UI component that displays a label for a checkbox
- Checkbox: a Material-UI component that allows users to select/deselect a checkbox
- Button: a Material-UI component that displays a button for triggering an action
- Typography: a Material-UI component that displays text
- AutocompleteSelect: a custom component that renders an autocomplete select input

Interaction Summary:
JiraSettings.tsx is a client-side component that interacts with other components in the UI package. It uses the useAppSettings hook to manage app settings and updates the app settings when the user saves changes. It also interacts with the AutocompleteSelect component to allow users to select default filters for Jira data.
