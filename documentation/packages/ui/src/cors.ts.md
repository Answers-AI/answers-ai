Filepath: packages/ui/src/cors.ts
Overview: Summary:
This file is responsible for initializing the CORS middleware for the Next.js application. It imports the Cors package and the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse interfaces from the Next.js framework.

Import statements:
- Cors: a package that provides middleware for enabling CORS in Express.js applications.
- NextApiRequest: an interface that defines the structure of the request object in Next.js API routes.
- NextApiResponse: an interface that defines the structure of the response object in Next.js API routes.

Script Summary:
The script defines a helper function called initMiddleware that takes a middleware function as a parameter and returns a new function that wraps the middleware function. The returned function takes the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse objects as parameters and returns a Promise that resolves with the result of the middleware function or rejects with an error if the middleware function throws an error.

The script then initializes the CORS middleware by calling the initMiddleware function with the Cors middleware function as a parameter. The Cors middleware is configured to only allow requests with GET, POST, and OPTIONS methods.

Finally, the script exports the initialized CORS middleware as the default export.

Internal Functions:
- initMiddleware: a helper function that takes a middleware function as a parameter and returns a new function that wraps the middleware function. The returned function takes the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse objects as parameters and returns a Promise that resolves with the result of the middleware function or rejects with an error if the middleware function throws an error.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the CORS middleware that can be used in Next.js API routes. Other files in the application can import this file and use the exported middleware to enable CORS in their API routes.

Developer Questions:
- What other middleware functions can be used with the initMiddleware helper function?
- How can the CORS middleware be configured to allow requests from specific origins?
- What other configuration options are available for the Cors middleware?
