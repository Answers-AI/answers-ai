Filepath: packages/ui/src/Auth.tsx
Overview: Summary:
This file is a React component that handles authentication for the application. It displays a login form or a list of providers to sign in with, depending on whether the user is already authenticated or not.

Import statements:
- `useRouter` from `next/navigation`: a hook for accessing the Next.js router
- `Box`, `Button`, `Container`, `TextField`, and `Typography` from `@mui/material`: UI components from the Material-UI library
- `Session` from `next-auth`: a type representing a user session
- `IntegrationsSettings` from `./IntegrationsSettings`: a component for displaying integration settings
- `AppSettings` from `types`: a type representing application settings
- `AppProviders`, `ClientSafeProvider`, and `signIn` from `next-auth/react`: authentication-related components and functions from the NextAuth library

Component:
The `Auth` component is a functional component that takes in a `session` and `providers` prop. If the `session` prop is defined, it means the user is already authenticated, so the component redirects to the home page. Otherwise, it displays a login form or a list of providers to sign in with.

Hooks:
None

Event Handlers:
None

Rendered components:
- `Container`: a Material-UI component that centers its children vertically and horizontally
- `Box`: a Material-UI component that groups its children together
- `Typography`: a Material-UI component for displaying text
- `Button`: a Material-UI component for clickable buttons
- `TextField`: a Material-UI component for text input

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by handling authentication. It relies on the `next-auth` library for authentication-related functionality, and it may redirect to the home page if the user is already authenticated.

Developer Questions:
- What is the `IntegrationsSettings` component and how is it used?
- What other components or pages rely on authentication and how do they interact with this component?
- How are authentication providers configured and passed to this component?
