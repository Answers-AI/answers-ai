Filepath: packages/ui/src/AppSyncToolbar.tsx
Overview: Summary:
This file contains the AppSyncToolbar component, which is responsible for rendering a toolbar with buttons for syncing data with various services. It uses the MUI Accordion component to display the buttons in a collapsible section.

Import statements:
- useAnswers: a custom hook that provides access to filter data
- axios: a library for making HTTP requests
- AppSettings, AppService: custom types for the application
- useFlags: a custom hook that provides access to feature flags
- ExpandMoreIcon: an MUI icon component

Component:
- AppSyncToolbar: a functional component that renders an Accordion containing buttons for syncing data with various services. It takes in three props: expanded (a boolean indicating whether the Accordion should be expanded by default), appSettings (an object containing settings for the application), and onSync (a callback function to be called when syncing is complete).

Hooks:
- useSync: a custom hook that takes in an onSync callback function and returns a handleSync function. handleSync takes in a serviceName string and uses axios to make a POST request to the /api/sync/{serviceName} endpoint with the current filters. If the request is successful, it calls the onSync callback function with the serviceName.

Event Handlers:
- handleSync: a function that takes in a serviceName string and uses axios to make a POST request to the /api/sync/{serviceName} endpoint with the current filters. If the request is successful, it calls the onSync callback function with the serviceName.

Rendered components:
- Accordion: an MUI component that displays collapsible content
- AccordionSummary: an MUI component that displays a summary of the Accordion content
- AccordionDetails: an MUI component that displays the details of the Accordion content
- Typography: an MUI component for displaying text
- Box: an MUI component for grouping other components together
- Button: an MUI component for displaying a clickable button

Interaction Summary:
This file is a client-side component that renders a toolbar for syncing data with various services. It interacts with the AnswersContext to access filter data, and uses axios to make HTTP requests to the /api/sync/{serviceName} endpoint. It also uses feature flags from Flagsmith to determine whether to display the toolbar. The onSync callback function can be used to update the UI after syncing is complete.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the AppSettings object?
- What is the purpose of the useFlags hook?
- What is the format of the /api/sync/{serviceName} endpoint?
- How is the onSync callback function used in the rest of the application?
