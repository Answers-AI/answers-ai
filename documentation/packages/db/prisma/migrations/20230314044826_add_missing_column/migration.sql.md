Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230314044826_add_missing_column/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that adds a missing column to the "Account" table in the database. The column being added is "refresh_token_expires_in" of type INTEGER.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The code in this file is a single SQL command that alters the "Account" table in the database by adding a new column called "refresh_token_expires_in" of type INTEGER.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses the Prisma ORM for database management. When the application is started, Prisma will check for any pending database migrations and apply them if necessary. This file will be executed during the migration process to add the missing column to the "Account" table in the database.

Developer Questions:
- What other database migrations are there in the application?
- What other tables in the database are related to the "Account" table?
- What happens if this migration fails to execute? How can we handle errors during the migration process?
- Are there any other parts of the application that depend on the "refresh_token_expires_in" column being present in the "Account" table?
