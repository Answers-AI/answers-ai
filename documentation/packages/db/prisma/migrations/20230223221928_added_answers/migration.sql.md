Overview: Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that creates a new table called "Answer" and adds a foreign key constraint to the "promptId" column. 

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The first part of the code creates a new table called "Answer" with three columns: "id", "promptId", and "text". The "id" column is a serial type and is set as the primary key. The "promptId" column is an integer type and is set as not null. The "text" column is a text type and is set as not null.

The second part of the code adds a foreign key constraint to the "promptId" column. This constraint references the "id" column of the "Prompt" table and is set to restrict deletion and cascade updates.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Prisma ORM to manage the database. It creates a new table and adds a foreign key constraint to an existing table. Other parts of the application may interact with this table to store and retrieve data.

Developer Questions:
- What other tables in the database are related to the "Answer" table?
- How does the "Answer" table fit into the overall data model of the application?
- What happens if the "Prompt" table is deleted or updated? How does this affect the "Answer" table?
- Are there any performance considerations when working with the "Answer" table, such as indexing or query optimization?
