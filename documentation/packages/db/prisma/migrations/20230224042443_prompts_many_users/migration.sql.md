Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230224042443_prompts_many_users/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that drops a column from the "Prompt" table and creates a new table "_PromptToUser" with foreign key constraints to the "Prompt" and "User" tables.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL commands.

Code Summary:
The file starts with a warning message about dropping the "userId" column from the "Prompt" table. It then proceeds to drop the foreign key constraint on the "userId" column, drop the column itself, and create a new table "_PromptToUser" with two non-null integer columns "A" and "B". It then creates two indexes on the new table and adds foreign key constraints to the "Prompt" and "User" tables.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL commands. It modifies the database schema by dropping a column and creating a new table with foreign key constraints. Other parts of the application that rely on the "Prompt" and "User" tables may be affected by these changes.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "_PromptToUser" table and how is it used in the application?
- What other parts of the application rely on the "Prompt" and "User" tables and how will they be affected by these changes?
- Are there any other parts of the application that need to be updated to reflect these schema changes?
- What happens if the migration script fails to execute? How can we roll back the changes?
