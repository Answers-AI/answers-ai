Overview: Summary:
This file contains a SQL migration script that adds two columns ("ok" and "state") to the "Account" table in the database.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL migration script.

Code Summary:
The SQL migration script uses the ALTER TABLE command to add two columns ("ok" and "state") to the "Account" table in the database.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL migration script. Once the migration is executed, the "Account" table in the database will have two new columns ("ok" and "state"). These columns can be used by other parts of the application to store additional information about user accounts.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "ok" and "state" columns?
- How will other parts of the application use these columns?
- Are there any other parts of the application that depend on these columns being present in the database?
- What happens if the migration script fails to execute?
