Overview: Summary:
This file contains SQL code for creating tables and adding foreign keys and indexes for a database schema. The tables created are "User", "AppSettings", "AppService", "JiraSettings", and "JiraProjectSetting".

Dependencies:
This file depends on a database management system that supports SQL, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Code Summary:
The code creates tables with columns and constraints, as well as indexes and foreign keys. The "User" table has columns for "id", "username", "email", "name", "appSettings", and "image". The "AppSettings" table has columns for "id" and "jiraSettingsId". The "AppService" table has columns for "id", "name", "enabled", and "appSettingsId". The "JiraSettings" table has only an "id" column. The "JiraProjectSetting" table has columns for "id", "key", "enabled", and "jiraSettingsId". The foreign keys link the "AppSettings", "AppService", and "JiraProjectSetting" tables to the "JiraSettings" table.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses a database to store user and application settings data. The tables created in this file are likely to be used by other parts of the application to store and retrieve data. Developers working on other parts of the application may need to modify this file to add or remove columns, constraints, indexes, or foreign keys.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of each table and column?
- How are the tables related to each other?
- What happens if a foreign key constraint is violated?
- How can I add or remove columns, constraints, indexes, or foreign keys?
