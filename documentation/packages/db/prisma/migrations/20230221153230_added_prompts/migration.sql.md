Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230221153230_added_prompts/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that creates a new table called "Prompt" and adds a foreign key constraint to the "userId" column, referencing the "id" column in the "User" table.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL commands.

Code Summary:
The file contains two SQL commands:
1. CREATE TABLE: This command creates a new table called "Prompt" with six columns: "id", "userId", "title", "description", "likes", and "prompt". The "id" column is a serial primary key, while the "userId" column is a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "User" table.
2. ALTER TABLE: This command adds a foreign key constraint to the "userId" column, referencing the "id" column in the "User" table. The constraint is set to restrict deletion of a user if there are associated prompts, and to cascade updates to the user's id if it changes.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses the Prisma ORM to manage the database. When the application starts up, Prisma will check for any pending migrations and execute them in order to update the database schema. This file will create a new "Prompt" table and add a foreign key constraint to ensure referential integrity between the "Prompt" and "User" tables.

Developer Questions:
1. What other tables are in the database schema?
2. What is the purpose of the "Prompt" table in the application?
3. What happens if a user is deleted while there are associated prompts?
4. How can I modify the "Prompt" table schema without losing data?
