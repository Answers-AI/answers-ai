Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230317140351_add_journeys/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file contains SQL code for a database migration that adds a "journeyId" column to the "Chat" table and creates two new tables, "Journey" and "_JourneyToUser", along with their respective constraints and indexes.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The SQL code in this file performs the following actions:
- Adds a "journeyId" column to the "Chat" table
- Creates a "Journey" table with columns for "id", "title", "filters", "createdAt", and "updatedAt"
- Creates a "_JourneyToUser" table with columns for "A" and "B"
- Creates a unique index on the "A" and "B" columns of the "_JourneyToUser" table
- Creates an index on the "B" column of the "_JourneyToUser" table
- Adds a foreign key constraint to the "Chat" table linking the "journeyId" column to the "id" column of the "Journey" table
- Adds two foreign key constraints to the "_JourneyToUser" table linking the "A" column to the "id" column of the "Journey" table and the "B" column to the "id" column of the "User" table

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that likely uses a database to store chat messages and user data. The migration defined in this file adds functionality for creating and managing "journeys", which are likely some kind of grouping or categorization system for chats. The addition of the "journeyId" column to the "Chat" table allows chats to be associated with a specific journey, and the creation of the "Journey" and "_JourneyToUser" tables provides the necessary data structures for managing journeys and their relationships with users.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "journey" feature and how is it used in the application?
- What other parts of the application depend on the "journey" feature and how might changes to this migration affect those parts?
- Are there any potential data consistency issues that could arise from the addition of the new tables and constraints? How can these be mitigated?
- How can we test the migration to ensure that it runs correctly and does not cause any data loss or corruption?
