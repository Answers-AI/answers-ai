Overview: Summary:
This file contains a SQL migration script that adds a new column called "filters" to the "Chat" table in the database.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM to execute the SQL migration script.

Code Summary:
The SQL migration script starts with a warning message that explains that the "filters" column has been added to the "Chat" table without a default value, which is not possible if the table is not empty. The script then uses the "ALTER TABLE" command to add the "filters" column to the "Chat" table with the data type "JSONB" and the constraint "NOT NULL".

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses the Prisma ORM to manage the database schema and data. When this migration script is executed, it will modify the "Chat" table in the database by adding a new column called "filters". This new column can then be used by other parts of the application to store additional data related to chats.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the "filters" column and how is it used in the application?
- What happens if the "Chat" table is not empty when this migration script is executed?
- Are there any other parts of the application that depend on the "Chat" table and could be affected by this migration script?
