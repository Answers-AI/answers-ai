Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230314061744_make_prompt_id_optional/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file contains SQL code for a database migration that makes the "promptId" column in the "Chat" table optional, and sets its foreign key constraint to "NULL" on deletion and cascades updates to the "id" column in the "Prompt" table.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The code in this file performs three SQL operations:
1. It drops the foreign key constraint on the "Chat" table's "promptId" column.
2. It alters the "promptId" column in the "Chat" table to be optional.
3. It adds a new foreign key constraint to the "Chat" table's "promptId" column, referencing the "id" column in the "Prompt" table, and setting the "promptId" column to "NULL" on deletion and cascading updates to the "id" column in the "Prompt" table.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the database schema and the Prisma ORM. It is part of a larger application that likely uses the "Chat" and "Prompt" tables to store and retrieve data. This migration could potentially affect any code that interacts with these tables, as the "promptId" column is now optional and its foreign key constraint has been changed.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application depend on the "Chat" and "Prompt" tables?
- How will this migration affect existing data in the "Chat" table?
- Are there any other migrations that depend on this one?
- What happens if the "Prompt" table is deleted or altered in the future?
