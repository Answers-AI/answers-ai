Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230314020820_migrate_to_messages/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file contains SQL code for a database migration that drops several tables, alters existing tables by adding columns, and creates new tables with constraints and foreign keys.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The SQL code in this file drops the Answer, Prompt, and _PromptToUser tables, and creates new Chat, Message, and _ChatToUser tables. It also alters existing tables (AppService, AppSettings, JiraProjectSetting, JiraSettings, and User) by adding createdAt and updatedAt columns. The code also creates several constraints and foreign keys for the new tables.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that uses a database managed by Prisma. The code in this file will be executed as part of a database migration process, which may be triggered manually or automatically when the application is deployed or updated. The new tables and altered columns will be used by other parts of the application to store and retrieve data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the new Chat and Message tables?
- How will the new tables be used by other parts of the application?
- What happens if the Answer, Prompt, or _PromptToUser tables are not empty when they are dropped?
- What is the significance of the usages, likes, and dislikes columns in the Message table?
- How can I modify the constraints and foreign keys in this file to better suit the needs of the application?
