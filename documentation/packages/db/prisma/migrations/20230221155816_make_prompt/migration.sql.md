Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230221155816_make_prompt/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file is a SQL migration script that adds two new columns to the "Prompt" table in the database and creates a unique index on the "prompt" column. The script also includes warnings about potential issues that may arise during the migration process.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The script first adds two new columns to the "Prompt" table: "dislikes" and "usages". These columns are required and cannot have default values. The script then creates a unique index on the "prompt" column of the "Prompt" table.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the database management system to modify the "Prompt" table. It is likely that other parts of the application rely on this table, so any changes made to it could potentially affect other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if there are existing duplicate values in the "prompt" column when the unique index is created?
- How will the application handle the addition of the "dislikes" and "usages" columns to the "Prompt" table?
- Are there any other parts of the application that rely on the "Prompt" table and could be affected by these changes?
