Overview: Summary:
This file contains SQL code for migrating the database schema to use UUIDs as primary keys for several tables. It drops foreign key constraints, alters table columns, and adds new foreign key constraints.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM and the underlying database management system.

Code Summary:
The code drops foreign key constraints for several tables, alters the data type of several columns, drops the existing primary key sequences, adds new primary key constraints using UUIDs, alters the data type of foreign key columns, and adds new foreign key constraints.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the database management system and the Prisma ORM. It is part of a larger application that likely uses the migrated schema to store and retrieve data.

Developer Questions:
- What other files in the application depend on this migration?
- What happens if the migration partially fails?
- How can I test the migration before applying it to a production database?
- What happens if I need to roll back the migration?
- Are there any performance implications of using UUIDs as primary keys?
