Overview: Summary:
This file contains SQL code for creating a table named "ChatApp" with various columns and constraints. It also creates unique indexes and foreign key constraints to other tables in the database.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The code creates a table named "ChatApp" with columns for id, name, email, apiKey, organizationId, userId, and appSettings. It then creates unique indexes for the email and apiKey columns. Finally, it adds foreign key constraints to the organizationId and userId columns, referencing the "Organization" and "User" tables respectively.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by creating a table that can be used to store data related to the ChatApp feature. Other parts of the application can then interact with this table by using the Prisma ORM to perform CRUD operations.

Developer Questions:
- What other tables in the database are related to the "ChatApp" table?
- What data types are allowed for the "appSettings" column?
- What happens if a record in the "Organization" table is deleted while it is referenced by a record in the "ChatApp" table?
- Can the foreign key constraints be modified or removed without causing issues in the application?
