Filepath: packages/db/prisma/migrations/20230324144416_add_organizations/migration.sql
Overview: Summary:
This file contains SQL code for a database migration that adds a new column to the "User" table and creates a new "Organization" table with several columns. It also adds a foreign key constraint between the "User" table and the "Organization" table.

Dependencies:
This file depends on the Prisma ORM for database management.

Code Summary:
The code in this file can be broken down into three parts:
1. AlterTable: This code adds two new columns to the "User" table - "organizationId" and "role".
2. CreateTable: This code creates a new "Organization" table with several columns - "id", "name", "image", "appSettings", "createdAt", and "updatedAt". It also sets the "id" column as the primary key.
3. AddForeignKey: This code adds a foreign key constraint between the "User" table's "organizationId" column and the "Organization" table's "id" column.

Interaction Summary:
This file is part of a larger application that likely uses a database to store user and organization information. This migration file is used to update the database schema to include the new "Organization" table and the "organizationId" column in the "User" table. This will allow the application to associate users with organizations and perform operations based on that association.

Developer Questions:
- What other parts of the application depend on the "User" and "Organization" tables?
- What happens if the migration fails or is interrupted?
- Are there any other database migrations that depend on this one?
- How will this migration affect existing data in the "User" table?
- Are there any performance implications of adding a new table and foreign key constraint?
