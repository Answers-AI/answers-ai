Filepath: packages/utils/src/slack/models/channel.js
Overview: Summary:
This file defines a class called SlackChannel that represents a Slack channel. It has methods to get information about the channel and its messages.

Import statements:
The file imports a class called SlackMessage from './message'.

Script Summary:
The SlackChannel class has a constructor that takes a Slack API client and a channel object as parameters. It sets the Slack API client and channel ID as properties of the class instance, and initializes a cache object with the channel information and an empty array for messages.

The class has two methods: getInfo() and getMessages(). getInfo() returns the cached channel information if it exists, otherwise it makes a call to the Slack API to get the channel information and caches it before returning it. getMessages() returns the cached messages if they exist, otherwise it makes calls to the Slack API to get all the messages in the channel and creates SlackMessage instances for each message. It also replaces user IDs with user objects in the message text if the message mentions any users. The messages are then cached and returned.

Internal Functions:
None.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Slack API client to get information about a Slack channel and its messages. It also interacts with the SlackMessage class to create instances of SlackMessage for each message in the channel.
