Filepath: packages/utils/src/slack/sync.js
Overview: Summary:
This file is responsible for syncing Slack channels and indexing their messages. It imports necessary utilities, models, and clients, initializes an AnswerSession, and provides two main functions: indexSingleSlackChannel and syncSlack.

Import statements:
- AnswerSession: A utility for managing answer sessions.
- SlackClient: A client for interacting with the Slack API.
- SlackMessage: A model representing a Slack message.
- SlackChannel: A model representing a Slack channel.

Script Summary:
The script initializes an AnswerSession with a namespace of 'slack' and sets up the Pinecone index. It then exports two main functions, indexSingleSlackChannel and syncSlack, which are responsible for indexing messages in a single Slack channel and syncing all Slack channels, respectively.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- indexSingleSlackChannel(channelId): Indexes messages in a single Slack channel with the given channelId. Returns nothing.
- syncSlack(): Syncs all Slack channels by indexing their messages. Returns nothing.

Interaction Summary:
This file could potentially interact with the rest of the application by being imported and called by other components or scripts that require syncing and indexing of Slack channels and their messages.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the AnswerSession utility, and how does it interact with Pinecone?
- How does the SlackClient handle authentication and API requests?
- Are there any limitations or rate limits when syncing and indexing Slack channels?
- How are errors handled within the syncSlack function, and what happens if an error occurs during the process?
- Are there any specific Slack channels that should be excluded from syncing and indexing?
