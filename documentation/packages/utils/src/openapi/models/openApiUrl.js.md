Overview: Summary:
This file defines a class called WebPage that extends another class called WebObject. It also exports the WebPage class. The class constructor takes in a webPage object, tidies it up, and sets some properties on the object. The tidy() function is a static function that takes in a webPage object, extracts some properties, and returns a new object with those properties. The createContext() function takes in an id and metadata object, creates a string with the id and metadata, and returns the string.

Import statements:
The file imports a class called WebObject from a file called webObject.js.

Script Summary:
The file defines a class called WebPage that extends another class called WebObject. It also exports the WebPage class. The class constructor takes in a webPage object, tidies it up, and sets some properties on the object. The tidy() function is a static function that takes in a webPage object, extracts some properties, and returns a new object with those properties. The createContext() function takes in an id and metadata object, creates a string with the id and metadata, and returns the string.

Internal Functions:
- tidy(webPage): This is a static function that takes in a webPage object and returns a new object with some properties extracted from the webPage object. It extracts the url and html properties from the webPage object and uses them to create a new object with properties objectType, url, and content. The content property is created by calling a static function called webToMarkdown() from the WebObject class.
- createContext(id, metadata): This function takes in an id and a metadata object and returns a string. It creates a string with the id and metadata by iterating over the keys of the metadata object, filtering out any keys with falsy values, and creating a string for each key-value pair. It then joins all the strings with commas and returns the final string.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file defines a class that could potentially be used by other parts of the application to represent web pages. The WebPage class extends the WebObject class, which could also be used by other parts of the application. The createContext() function could potentially be used by other parts of the application to create strings with metadata.

Developer Questions:
- What is the WebObject class and how is it used?
- What other classes or functions use the WebPage class?
- What is the purpose of the createContext() function and where is it used?
