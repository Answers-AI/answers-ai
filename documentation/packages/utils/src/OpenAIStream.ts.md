Overview: Summary:
This file contains a function called OpenAIStream that creates a ReadableStream object that fetches data from the OpenAI API and parses it using an eventsource-parser library. The function takes in a payload and extra data, and returns a stream object that can be used to read the data.

Import statements:
The file imports createParser, ParsedEvent, ReconnectInterval from the eventsource-parser library.

Script Summary:
The OpenAIStream function creates a ReadableStream object that fetches data from the OpenAI API and parses it using an eventsource-parser library. The function takes in a payload and extra data, and returns a stream object that can be used to read the data.

Internal Functions:
- onParse: This function takes in an event object and parses it using the eventsource-parser library. It then enqueues the parsed data into the stream object.

External Functions:
- OpenAIStream: This function takes in a payload and extra data, and returns a ReadableStream object that fetches data from the OpenAI API and parses it using an eventsource-parser library.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API to fetch data and parse it using the eventsource-parser library. The parsed data is then enqueued into a stream object that can be used to read the data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the payload that needs to be passed to the OpenAIStream function?
- What is the format of the data returned by the OpenAI API?
- How can the stream object returned by the OpenAIStream function be used to read the data?
- What happens if there is an error while parsing the data?
