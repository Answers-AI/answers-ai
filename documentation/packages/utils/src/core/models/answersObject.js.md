Filepath: packages/utils/src/core/models/answersObject.js
Overview: Summary:
This file contains the AnswersObject class which is used to create an object with context, embedding, and vector properties. It also includes functions to prepare the object for embedding and create the embedding and vector.

Import statements:
- OpenAI: an external module for creating embeddings
- Vector: an internal utility module for creating vectors

Script Summary:
- Defines the AnswersObject class with a constructor that takes an object as a parameter
- Includes functions to get the context, prepare the object for embedding, create the embedding, and create the vector
- Exports the AnswersObject class

Internal Functions:
- createContextFromObject(obj): takes an object and returns a string of its properties formatted for embedding
  - Parameters: obj (object) - the object to create the context from
  - Returns: context (string) - the formatted string of the object's properties
- createEmbedding(): creates an embedding for the object's context using the OpenAI module
  - Returns: embedding (array) - the embedding array
- createVector(): creates a vector for the object using the Vector module
  - Returns: vector (object) - the vector object

External Functions:
- constructor(object): creates a new AnswersObject instance with the provided object
  - Parameters: object (object) - the object to create the AnswersObject from
- getContext(): gets the context string for the AnswersObject instance
  - Returns: context (string) - the context string
- prepareForEmbedding(): prepares the AnswersObject instance for embedding by getting the context, creating the embedding, and creating the vector
  - Returns: vector (object) - the vector object

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to create AnswersObject instances which can be used throughout the application to represent objects with context, embedding, and vector properties. These instances can be used for various purposes such as natural language processing and machine learning.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the AnswersObject class and how is it used in the application?
- How does the createContextFromObject function format the object's properties for embedding?
- What is the OpenAI module and how is it used to create embeddings?
- What is the Vector module and how is it used to create vectors?
- How are AnswersObject instances used in other parts of the application?
