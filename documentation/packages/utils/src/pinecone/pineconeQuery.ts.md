Filepath: packages/utils/src/pinecone/pineconeQuery.ts
Overview: Summary:
This file contains code for querying a Pinecone database using embeddings and OpenAI API. It exports a function called pineconeQuery that takes in embeddings and optional parameters for filtering and namespace. It also initializes an instance of PineconeClient and OpenAIApi.

Import statements:
- Configuration and OpenAIApi from 'openai': These are dependencies for using OpenAI API.
- AnswersFilters from 'types': This is a custom type for filtering Pinecone queries.
- PineconeClient from '@pinecone-database/pinecone': This is a dependency for interacting with Pinecone databases.

Script Summary:
The script initializes an instance of PineconeClient and OpenAIApi. It then exports a function called pineconeQuery that takes in embeddings and optional parameters for filtering and namespace. The function queries a Pinecone database using the embeddings and returns the results.

Internal Functions:
- initializeOpenAI(): This function initializes an instance of OpenAIApi using an API key from the environment variables. It returns the instance.

External Functions:
- pineconeQuery(embeddings: number[], { filter, topK = 20, namespace = process.env.PINECONE_INDEX_NAMESPACE }: { filter?: any; topK?: number; namespace?: string }): This function takes in embeddings and optional parameters for filtering and namespace. It queries a Pinecone database using the embeddings and returns the results.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with Pinecone databases and OpenAI API. It exports a function that can be used by other parts of the application to query Pinecone databases.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the embeddings parameter?
- What are the possible values for the filter parameter?
- What is the format of the returned data?
- How can I configure the PineconeClient instance?
- How can I configure the OpenAIApi instance?
