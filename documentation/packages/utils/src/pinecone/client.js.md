Filepath: packages/utils/src/pinecone/client.js
Overview: Summary:
This file defines a PineconeClient class that interacts with the Pinecone database. It has methods for initializing the client, deleting an index, writing a single vector to an index, and writing multiple vectors to an index.

Import statements:
The file imports the chunkArray function from '../utilities/utils' and the PineconeClient class from '@pinecone-database/pinecone'.

Script Summary:
The PineconeClient class constructor takes a configuration object as a parameter and initializes the client with the provided API key and environment. It also sets the namespace and index name properties and calls the init method. The class has methods for deleting an index, deleting an index by name, writing a single vector to an index, and writing multiple vectors to an index.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): Initializes the PineconeClient object with the provided configuration object. Throws an error if the API key or environment is missing.
- async init(): Initializes the Pinecone client with the API key and environment.
- async deleteIndex(index): Deletes the specified index.
- async deleteIndexByName(indexName): Deletes the index with the specified name.
- async writeVectorToIndex(vector): Writes a single vector to the index.
- async writeVectorsToIndex(vectors): Writes multiple vectors to the index in chunks of 100.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the Pinecone database through the PineconeClient class. It could be used by other parts of the application to read and write data to the database.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the configuration object passed to the constructor?
- How does the chunkArray function work and why is it used?
- What is the difference between deleteIndex and deleteIndexByName?
- How are vectors stored in the Pinecone database?
- How does the PineconeClient class interact with other parts of the application?
