Filepath: packages/utils/src/utilities/utils.ts
Overview: Summary:
This file contains a single function called `chunkArray` that takes an array and a chunk size as input and returns an array of smaller arrays, each containing a maximum of `chunkSize` elements.

Import statements:
This file does not have any import statements.

Script Summary:
This file exports a single function called `chunkArray` that takes an array and a chunk size as input and returns an array of smaller arrays, each containing a maximum of `chunkSize` elements.

Internal Functions:
This file does not have any internal functions.

External Functions:
- `chunkArray(array: T[], chunkSize: number): T[][]`
  - This function takes an array of type `T` and a chunk size as input and returns an array of smaller arrays, each containing a maximum of `chunkSize` elements. The function uses the `Array.from` method to create a new array with a length equal to the number of chunks required to split the input array. The second argument to `Array.from` is a mapping function that takes two arguments: the current value and the current index. The mapping function uses the `slice` method to extract a chunk of the input array starting at the current index and with a length equal to `chunkSize`.

Interaction Summary:
This file could potentially interact with other parts of the application that need to split an array into smaller chunks. For example, if the application needs to process a large dataset in parallel, it could use this function to split the dataset into smaller chunks that can be processed independently.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected behavior if the input array has fewer elements than the chunk size?
- What is the expected behavior if the input array is empty?
- Can the chunk size be zero or negative?
