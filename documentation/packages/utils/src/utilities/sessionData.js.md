Filepath: packages/utils/src/utilities/sessionData.js
Overview: Summary:
This file contains a class called AnswerSession that has functions for initializing a Pinecone client, adding and replacing vectors, writing vectors to a file, and preparing objects for embedding.

Import statements:
The file imports the fs module for file system operations and a PineconeClient class from another file in the application.

Script Summary:
The AnswerSession class has functions for managing vectors and writing them to a file. It also has a function for preparing objects for embedding.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): initializes the AnswerSession object with a vectors array and any additional configuration options passed in as an object.
- initPinecone(options): creates a new PineconeClient object with the specified options and sets it as a property of the AnswerSession object.
- addVectors(vectors): adds one or more vectors to the vectors array.
- replaceVectors(vectors): replaces the vectors array with a new array containing the specified vectors.
- clearVectors(): empties the vectors array.
- writeVectorsToFile(): writes the vectors array to a file, splitting the data into multiple files if the total size exceeds a certain limit.
- prepareAllForEmbedding(objects): prepares an array of objects for embedding by calling a prepareForEmbedding function on each object and returning an array of statuses.

External Functions:
- none

Interaction Summary:
This file could be used by other parts of the application to manage and write vectors to a file. It could also be used to prepare objects for embedding.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the PineconeClient class and how is it used?
- What is the maximum file size for writing vectors and why was this limit chosen?
- How are the vectors split into multiple files when the total size exceeds the limit?
- What is the prepareForEmbedding function and how does it work?
