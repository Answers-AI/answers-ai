Filepath: packages/utils/src/utilities/answerSession.js
Overview: Summary:
This file contains the AnswerSession class which is responsible for managing vectors and writing them to files. It also has a function for preparing objects for embedding.

Import statements:
- fs: a Node.js module for interacting with the file system
- Pinecone: a third-party library for managing embeddings

Script Summary:
- AnswerSession class with methods for adding, replacing, and clearing vectors
- Method for writing vectors to files
- Method for preparing objects for embedding

Internal Functions:
- constructor(config): initializes the AnswerSession object with a vectors array and any additional configuration options
- initPinecone(options): initializes a Pinecone object with the provided options
- addVectors(vectors): adds one or more vectors to the vectors array
- replaceVectors(vectors): replaces the vectors array with the provided vectors
- clearVectors(): clears the vectors array
- writeVectorsToFile(): writes the vectors array to one or more files
- prepareAllForEmbedding(objects): prepares an array of objects for embedding by calling their prepareForEmbedding() method

External Functions:
- N/A

Interaction Summary:
- This file could be used by other parts of the application to manage and write vectors to files. It could also be used in conjunction with the Pinecone library to manage embeddings.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the vectors array?
- How are vectors added, replaced, and cleared?
- What is the format of the output files?
- How does the prepareAllForEmbedding() function work?
- How does this file interact with other parts of the application?
