Filepath: packages/utils/src/deepmerge.ts
Overview: Summary:
This file contains a function called "deepmerge" which takes in a target object and one or more source objects and merges them together recursively. It also contains a helper function called "isObject" which checks if an item is an object and not an array.

Import statements:
None.

Script Summary:
The "deepmerge" function takes in a target object and one or more source objects and merges them together recursively. It first checks if there are any sources to merge, and if not, it returns the target object. It then takes the first source object and checks if both the target and source are objects. If they are, it loops through each key in the source object and recursively calls the "deepmerge" function on any nested objects. If the key is not an object, it simply assigns the value to the target object. Finally, it calls itself with the updated target object and remaining source objects until there are no more sources left.

Internal Functions:
- isObject(item: any): This function takes in an item and checks if it is an object and not an array. It returns a boolean value.

External Functions:
- deepmerge(target: { [x: string]: any }, ...sources: any[]): This function takes in a target object and one or more source objects and merges them together recursively. It returns the merged object.

Interaction Summary:
This file is a utility function that can be used by other parts of the application to merge objects together. It does not interact with any third-party libraries or APIs.

Developer Questions:
- What happens if one of the source objects is null or undefined?
- Can this function handle circular references in objects?
- How does this function handle conflicts between keys in the target and source objects?
- Is there a limit to the depth of nested objects that this function can handle?
