Overview: Summary:
This file defines a JiraStatus class that extends the JiraObject class. It also includes a static tidy function that removes certain fields from a status object.

Import statements:

Script Summary:
The JiraStatus class constructor takes a status object as a parameter, tidies it using the static tidy function, and then calls the constructor of the parent JiraObject class with the tidied status object. It also sets the objectType, statusCategoryId, and uid properties of the object.

Internal Functions:
