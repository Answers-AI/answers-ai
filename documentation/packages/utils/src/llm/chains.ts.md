Filepath: packages/utils/src/llm/chains.ts
Overview: Summary:
This file contains code related to language models and chains used in the larger application. It imports various dependencies and exports functions related to creating chat chains, summarization chains, and raw chains.

Import statements:
- LLMChain: a class for creating language model chains
- ChatOpenAI: a class for creating chat models using OpenAI
- OpenAI: a class for creating language models using OpenAI
- ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate: classes for creating prompts for chat models
- Message: a type for representing chat messages
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: a class for splitting text into smaller chunks recursively
- Configuration, OpenAIApi: classes for configuring and using the OpenAI API
- assistantPrompt, chatPrompt, intentionPrompt, rawPrompt: various prompts for chat models
- summarizeQAPrompt, summarizePrompt: prompts for summarization chains
- getCompletionRequest: a function for creating completion requests for chat models

Script Summary:
This file exports functions for creating chat chains, summarization chains, and raw chains. It also initializes an OpenAI instance and creates a ChatOpenAI instance.

Internal Functions:
- initializeOpenAI: initializes an OpenAI instance using an API key from an environment variable

External Functions:
- createChatChain: creates a chat chain using a ChatOpenAI instance and a set of messages
- summarizeChain: a summarization chain using an OpenAI instance and a summarization prompt
- summarizeQAChain: a summarization chain using a ChatOpenAI instance and a QA summarization prompt
- rawChain: a raw chain using a ChatOpenAI instance and a raw prompt

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with other parts of the application by exporting functions that can be used to create language model chains for chat and summarization. These chains can be used to generate responses to user input or summarize text.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of each chain exported from this file?
- How are the prompts for each chain constructed?
- How does the OpenAI API key get passed to the initializeOpenAI function?
- How are completion requests constructed for chat models?
