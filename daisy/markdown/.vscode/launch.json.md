Summary:
This configuration file is used in a larger application to define various tasks and configurations for different debugging scenarios. It includes tasks for clearing a specific folder, as well as configurations for debugging the server-side, client-side, and full stack of the application.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not explicitly mentioned in the file itself. However, based on the provided configurations, it appears to be related to a web application built with Node.js and using pnpm as the package manager.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file defines three different debugging configurations: "AnswerAI: debug server-side", "AnswerAI: debug client-side", and "AnswerAI: debug full stack". Each configuration specifies the type of debugging (e.g., "node-terminal" or "chrome"), the command to run, and additional settings such as pre-launch tasks and server ready actions.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "version": Specifies the version of the configuration file.
- "tasks": Defines tasks that can be executed, such as clearing a specific folder.
- "configurations": Contains an array of debugging configurations.
  - "name": The name of the debugging configuration.
  - "type": Specifies the type of debugging, such as "node-terminal" or "chrome".
  - "request": Specifies the type of request to make for debugging, such as "launch".
  - "command": The command to run for debugging.
  - "url": The URL to open for client-side debugging.
  - "preLaunchTask": The task to execute before launching the debugging session.
  - "serverReadyAction": Specifies an action to take when the server is ready, such as opening a URL in a browser.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the larger application by providing predefined debugging configurations and tasks. Developers can use these configurations to easily debug different parts of the application, such as the server-side, client-side, or the entire stack. The tasks defined in the file can be executed to perform specific actions, such as clearing a folder before launching a debugging session.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add a new debugging configuration to this file?
2. What is the purpose of the "preLaunchTask" property in a debugging configuration?
3. How can I customize the server ready action when using the "AnswerAI: debug full stack" configuration?
4. Can I define additional tasks in this configuration file? If so, how do I use them?
5. How can I integrate this configuration file with a specific IDE or debugging tool?
