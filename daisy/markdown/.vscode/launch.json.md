Summary:
This configuration file is used in a larger application to define various tasks and configurations. It includes tasks for clearing a specific folder, as well as configurations for debugging the server-side, client-side, and full stack of the application.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not explicitly mentioned in the provided file. However, based on the configurations, it appears to be a web application built with Node.js and uses pnpm as the package manager.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file defines tasks and configurations for different debugging scenarios in the application. It includes a task to clear the ".next" folder, which is likely a build output folder. The configurations specify the type of debugging (server-side, client-side, or full stack), the command to run for debugging, and additional settings like pre-launch tasks and server ready actions.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "version": Specifies the version of the configuration file.
- "tasks": Defines tasks that can be executed.
  - "clearNextFolder": A task to clear the ".next" folder using the "rm" command.
- "configurations": Defines different debugging configurations.
  - "name": The name of the configuration.
  - "type": The type of debugging (e.g., "node-terminal" or "chrome").
  - "request": The type of request to make for debugging (e.g., "launch").
  - "command": The command to run for debugging.
  - "url": The URL to open for client-side debugging.
  - "preLaunchTask": The task to execute before launching the debugging session.
  - "serverReadyAction": Specifies an action to take when the server is ready.
    - "pattern": A regular expression pattern to match the server ready message.
    - "uriFormat": The format of the URI extracted from the server ready message.
    - "action": The action to perform when the server is ready.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file allows developers to easily configure and execute different debugging scenarios in the application. It provides flexibility in choosing the type of debugging (server-side, client-side, or full stack) and allows for additional tasks to be executed before launching the debugging session. The server ready action also enables integration with external tools or services.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I add a new task to the configuration file?
2. What is the purpose of the "preLaunchTask" property in the configurations?
3. How can I customize the server ready action to work with a different server setup?
4. Can I add more configurations for different debugging scenarios?
5. How do I configure the application to use a different package manager instead of pnpm?
