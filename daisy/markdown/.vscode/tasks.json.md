Summary:
This configuration file is used in a larger application to define tasks that need to be executed. It specifies a version number and a list of tasks to be performed. The provided file includes a single task labeled "Clear .next folder" which is a shell command to remove the ".next" folder within the "apps/web" directory.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not explicitly mentioned in the provided file. However, based on the task specified, it appears to be related to a web application built with a framework that uses a ".next" folder for server-side rendering or static site generation.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file is structured as a JSON object. It includes a "version" field, which indicates the version of the configuration file format being used. In this case, the version is "2.0.0". It also contains a "tasks" field, which is an array of task objects. Each task object represents a specific task to be executed.

Configuration Breakdown:
- version: Specifies the version of the configuration file format being used.
- tasks: An array of task objects. Each task object can have the following properties:
  - label: A descriptive label for the task.
  - type: The type of task. In this case, it is "shell", indicating a shell command.
  - command: The command to be executed. In this example, it is "rm -rf apps/web/.next", which removes the ".next" folder.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file defines tasks that can be executed as part of a larger application's build or deployment process. The tasks specified in this file can be integrated into a build system or deployment pipeline to automate certain actions, such as clearing a specific folder before building or deploying the application.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional tasks to be executed in this configuration file?
2. Can I specify dependencies between tasks to ensure they are executed in a specific order?
3. What other types of tasks are supported besides shell commands?
4. How can I pass arguments or variables to the commands in the tasks?
5. Can I configure the behavior of the tasks based on different environments (e.g., development, production)?
6. How can I handle errors or failures in the tasks and customize the error handling behavior?
7. Is there a way to schedule or trigger the execution of these tasks automatically?
8. Can I define reusable task templates or functions to avoid duplicating code across multiple tasks?
9. How can I test or simulate the execution of these tasks without affecting the actual application or environment?
10. Are there any security considerations when executing shell commands specified in the tasks?
