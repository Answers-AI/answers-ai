The "extends" property is an array containing the string "custom", which tells ESLint to load the configuration from the package "eslint-config-custom". The "settings" property is an object with a single property "next", which is an object itself. The "next" object has a property "rootDir" set to an array containing the string "apps/*/", indicating that the root directory for Next.js applications should be considered.
