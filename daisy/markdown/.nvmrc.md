The purpose of this code is to provide a version number for the software application. It is a simple script that returns the version number "18.13.0". It does not have any specific role within the broader software application, as it only provides a static version number.

The structure of the script is straightforward. It consists of a single line of code enclosed in triple quotes, which is a string literal representing the version number.

There are no import statements in this script. Import statements are used to bring in external modules or libraries into the code, but in this case, there are no external dependencies.

Since there are no classes or functions defined in the code, there is no need for detailed descriptions of classes and functions.

There are no loops or conditional statements in this code. It is a simple one-liner that returns a static value.

The code does not use any variables. It directly returns the version number as a string literal.

There are no known issues or bugs with this code, as it is a simple and static version number. There are no todo items to address either.

In summary, this code serves the purpose of providing a version number for the software application. It is a simple script with a single line of code that returns the version number as a string literal. It does not have any dependencies, classes, functions, loops, or conditional statements. There are no known issues or bugs with this code.
