Summary:
The purpose of this code is to define custom commands for Cypress, a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework. These custom commands are used to perform common actions, such as logging in, during test automation. The code defines a "login" command that visits a sign-in page, enters an API key, and submits the form.

Import statements:
- There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
- The code defines a custom command called "login" using the Cypress.Commands.add() method.
- The "login" command retrieves an API key from the Cypress environment variables using Cypress.env() and visits a sign-in page.
- The command then finds an input field with the ID "input-apiKey-for-app-widget-provider" and types the API key into it.
- Finally, the command submits the form by pressing the "enter" key.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- Cypress.Commands.add('login', () => {...}): This function defines the custom "login" command. It does not take any parameters and does not return anything.

Interaction Summary:
This code interacts with the Cypress testing framework by defining a custom command that can be used in test scripts. Other test scripts can call the "login" command to log in a user using a default test user.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use this custom "login" command in my test scripts?
- Can I modify the "login" command to use a different API key or sign-in page?
- Are there any other custom commands available in Cypress that I can use?
