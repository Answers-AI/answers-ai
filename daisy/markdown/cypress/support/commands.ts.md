Summary:
The purpose of this code is to define custom commands for Cypress, a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework. These custom commands are used to perform specific actions during test automation, such as logging in a user using a default test user. The code is structured as a Cypress command file, with each custom command defined using the `Cypress.Commands.add()` method.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
This script defines a custom command called `login()` using the `Cypress.Commands.add()` method. This command is used to log in a user by visiting the `/api/auth/signin` page and entering an API key. The API key is retrieved from the `ANSWERS_API_KEY` environment variable.

Internal Functions:
- `login()`: This function is a custom command that logs in a user. It retrieves the API key from the `ANSWERS_API_KEY` environment variable, visits the `/api/auth/signin` page, and enters the API key in the input field with the ID `input-apiKey-for-app-widget-provider`.

External Functions:
There are no external functions in this code.

Interaction Summary:
This code interacts with the Cypress testing framework by defining custom commands that can be used in test scripts. These custom commands provide a convenient way to perform common actions, such as logging in a user, during test automation.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `login()` custom command in my test scripts?
- How can I modify the `login()` command to use a different API key?
- Can I define additional custom commands in this file?
- Are there any other custom commands available in Cypress that I can use?
