Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional linting rules or modify existing ones?
   - To add or modify linting rules, you can update the "rules" property of the exported object. Each rule is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the rule and the value is its configuration. You can refer to the documentation of the respective linting plugins (e.g., '@next/next', 'turbo') to understand the available rules and their configurations.

2. Can I extend or override the configuration presets?
   - Yes, you can extend or override the configuration presets by modifying the "extends" property of the exported object. You can add or remove preset names from the array to include or exclude specific configurations. Make sure to refer to the documentation of the frameworks and plugins to understand the effects of extending or overriding presets.

3. How can I enable or disable specific linting rules?
   - To enable or disable specific linting rules, you can update the "rules" property of the exported object. Set the value of a rule to 'off' to disable it or provide a specific configuration to enable it. Refer to the documentation of the respective linting plugins to understand the available rules and their configurations.
