Interaction Summary:
This code snippet is a configuration file that can be used by a software application built with Next.js and Turbo. It extends the default configuration of these frameworks and provides additional rules and settings specific to the application.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional linting rules or modify existing ones?
   - To add or modify linting rules, you can update the "rules" property in the exported object. Each rule is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the rule and the value is its configuration. You can refer to the documentation of the respective linting plugins (e.g., '@next/next', 'turbo') for available rules and their configurations.

2. How can I extend the configuration with additional presets?
   - To extend the configuration with additional presets, you can add their names to the "extends" array in the exported object. The presets should be installed and configured in the application's dependencies.
