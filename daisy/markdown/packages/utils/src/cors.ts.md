Summary:
This code is a multi-purpose CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) library. It provides functionality to handle CORS headers and allow cross-origin requests in a web application. The code defines various types, interfaces, and functions to handle CORS headers and configure CORS behavior. The main function, `cors`, is responsible for processing incoming requests and setting the appropriate CORS headers in the response.

Import statements:
- No external dependencies are imported in this code.

Script Summary:
The script defines types and interfaces related to CORS options and headers. It also provides functions to handle CORS headers and configure CORS behavior. The main function, `cors`, processes incoming requests and sets the appropriate CORS headers in the response. Additionally, there is an `initCors` function that returns a middleware function for integrating CORS handling into a web application.

Internal Functions:
- `isOriginAllowed(origin: string, allowed: StaticOrigin): boolean`: This function checks if a given origin is allowed based on the provided allowed origins. It recursively checks if the origin matches any of the allowed origins, which can be a boolean, string, regular expression, or an array of these types. It returns a boolean indicating whether the origin is allowed.
- `getOriginHeaders(reqOrigin: string | undefined, origin: StaticOrigin): Headers`: This function generates the appropriate CORS headers based on the requested origin and the allowed origin(s). It creates a new `Headers` object and sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header accordingly. If the allowed origin is "*", it sets the header to "*", allowing any origin. If the allowed origin is a string, it sets the header to that string. If the allowed origin is an array or a regular expression, it checks if the requested origin matches any of the allowed origins and sets the header accordingly. It also appends the "Vary" header to indicate that the response varies based on the origin.
- `originHeadersFromReq(req: Request, origin: StaticOrigin | OriginFn): Promise<Headers | undefined>`: This async function retrieves the requested origin from the request headers and calls `getOriginHeaders` to generate the appropriate CORS headers based on the requested origin and the allowed origin(s). If the `origin` parameter is a function, it calls that function with the requested origin and the request object to determine the allowed origin(s). It returns a promise that resolves to the generated CORS headers or `undefined` if no headers are generated.
- `getAllowedHeaders(req: Request, allowed?: string | string[]): Headers`: This function generates the appropriate CORS headers for the allowed headers. It creates a new `Headers` object and sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header based on the provided allowed headers. If no allowed headers are provided, it retrieves the headers from the request object and sets the `Vary` header to indicate that the response varies based on the requested headers. If the allowed headers are an array, it converts them to a comma-separated string. It returns the generated CORS headers.

External Functions:
- `cors(req: Request, res: Response, options?: CorsOptions): Promise<Response>`: This is the main function of the script. It handles the CORS logic for incoming requests. It takes in the request object, response object, and an optional `CorsOptions` object to configure the CORS behavior. It merges the provided options with the default options. It calls `originHeadersFromReq` to retrieve the CORS headers based on the requested origin and the allowed origin(s). If no CORS headers are generated, it returns the original response object. Otherwise, it merges the generated headers with the response headers. If the `credentials` option is set to `true`, it sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`. If the `exposedHeaders` option is provided, it sets the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header based on the provided value. If the request method is "OPTIONS", it handles the preflight request by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header, calling `getAllowedHeaders` to set the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header, setting the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header if the `maxAge` option is provided, and returning a new response object with the appropriate status code and headers. For normal requests, it returns the original response object with the merged CORS headers.
- `initCors(options?: CorsOptions): (req: Request, res: Response) => Promise<Response>`: This function returns a middleware function for integrating CORS handling into a web application. It takes in an optional `CorsOptions` object to configure the CORS behavior. It returns a function that takes in the request object and response object and calls the `cors` function with the provided options.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a middleware in a web application to handle CORS headers and allow cross-origin requests. It can be integrated into the application by calling the `initCors` function and passing the desired CORS options. The returned middleware function can then be used to handle incoming requests and set the appropriate CORS headers in the response.

Developer Questions:
- How do I configure the allowed origins, methods, headers, and other CORS options?
- Can I use a function to dynamically determine the allowed origins based on the request?
- How can I integrate this CORS library into my existing web application?
- What happens if a request does not include the required CORS headers?
- How can I handle preflight requests and set the appropriate CORS headers?
- Can I customize the status code and headers for preflight requests?
- How can I test the CORS behavior of my application during development?
