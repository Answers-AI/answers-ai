Summary:
This code is a script that imports the Redis class from the 'ioredis' library and creates a new instance of the Redis class using the REDIS_URL environment variable. The purpose of this script is to establish a connection to a Redis server and provide a Redis client object that can be used to interact with the Redis server.

Import statements:
- `import { Redis } from 'ioredis';`: This statement imports the Redis class from the 'ioredis' library. The Redis class provides methods for interacting with a Redis server.

Script Summary:
The script creates a Redis client object using the Redis class from the 'ioredis' library. The Redis client object is then exported as a constant named 'redis'. The REDIS_URL environment variable is used to configure the connection to the Redis server.

Internal Functions:
None

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script could be imported and used by other parts of the application that need to interact with a Redis server. The 'redis' constant can be accessed to obtain the Redis client object and perform operations such as setting and getting values from the Redis server.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use the 'redis' constant to interact with the Redis server?
- What happens if the REDIS_URL environment variable is not set?
- Are there any additional configuration options for the Redis client object that I can set?
