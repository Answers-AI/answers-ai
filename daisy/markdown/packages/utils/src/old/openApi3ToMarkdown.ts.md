Summary:
The purpose of this script is to convert an OpenAPI specification (in the form of a JSON object) into a Markdown document. The Markdown document will contain information about the API endpoints, their parameters, request bodies, and responses. The script takes in an OpenAPI specification object and returns a string in Markdown format.

Import statements:
- `import { OpenAPIV3_1 } from 'openapi-types';`: This import statement brings in the `OpenAPIV3_1` type definition from the `openapi-types` module. This type definition is used to provide type annotations for the OpenAPI specification object.

Script Summary:
The script defines a single function `openApiToMarkdown` that takes in an OpenAPI specification object and returns a string in Markdown format. The function iterates over the paths, operations, and responses defined in the OpenAPI specification object and generates the Markdown output.

Internal Functions:
- `openApiToMarkdown`: This is the main function of the script. It takes in an OpenAPI specification object (`openApiSpec`) and returns a string in Markdown format. The function first checks if the `openApiSpec` has a `paths` property. If not, it returns an empty string. It then initializes the `output` variable with the heading for the OpenAPI specification. The function then iterates over the paths in the `openApiSpec` and for each path, it adds the path-level parameters, operations, and responses to the `output` string. Finally, it returns the `output` string.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility function within a larger software application that deals with OpenAPI specifications. It can be called with an OpenAPI specification object and the resulting Markdown string can be used for documentation purposes.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the output format of the Markdown document?
- Can I add additional information to the Markdown document, such as examples or additional descriptions?
- How can I handle nested paths or operations in the OpenAPI specification?
- What happens if the OpenAPI specification object is invalid or missing required properties?

Known Issues or Bugs:
- The script does not handle nested paths or operations in the OpenAPI specification. It assumes a flat structure where all paths and operations are at the top level.
- The script does not handle references to components in the OpenAPI specification. It assumes that all objects are fully expanded and does not follow references.
- The script does not handle all possible properties and variations of the OpenAPI specification. It focuses on the most common properties and assumes a certain structure.

Todo Items:
- Handle nested paths and operations in the OpenAPI specification.
- Handle references to components in the OpenAPI specification.
- Add support for additional properties and variations of the OpenAPI specification.
