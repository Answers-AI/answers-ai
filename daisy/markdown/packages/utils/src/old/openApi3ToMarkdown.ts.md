Summary:
The purpose of this script is to convert an OpenAPI specification (in the form of a JSON object) into a Markdown document. The Markdown document will contain information about the API endpoints, their parameters, request bodies, and responses. The script takes in an OpenAPI specification object and returns a string in Markdown format.

Import statements:
- `import { OpenAPIV3_1 } from 'openapi-types';`: This import statement brings in the `OpenAPIV3_1` type definition from the `openapi-types` module. This type definition is used to provide type annotations for the OpenAPI specification object.

Script Summary:
The script defines a single function `openApiToMarkdown` that takes in an OpenAPI specification object and returns a string in Markdown format. The function iterates over the paths, operations, parameters, request bodies, and responses defined in the OpenAPI specification object and generates the corresponding Markdown content.

Internal Functions:
- `openApiToMarkdown`: This is the main function of the script. It takes in an OpenAPI specification object (`openApiSpec`) and returns a string in Markdown format. The function first checks if the `openApiSpec` has a `paths` property. If not, it returns an empty string. It then initializes the `output` variable with the heading for the OpenAPI specification. The function then iterates over the paths in the `openApiSpec` and for each path, it generates Markdown content for path-level parameters, operations, operation-level parameters, request body, and responses. The generated Markdown content is appended to the `output` variable. Finally, the function returns the `output` string.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility function within a larger software application that deals with OpenAPI specifications. It can be called with an OpenAPI specification object and the generated Markdown content can be used for documentation purposes.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the Markdown output format?
- Can this script handle OpenAPI specifications of different versions?
- What happens if the OpenAPI specification object is missing required properties?
- How can I extend this script to support additional features of the OpenAPI specification?
