Summary:
This code is a script that builds settings for a user in an application. It imports various modules and functions to retrieve user information and client connections. It then merges the user and organization settings with system settings to create a new settings object. The script also makes API calls to retrieve additional data for specific modules like Jira, Slack, and Confluence. Finally, it adds some default settings for other modules like Airtable, Zoom, and YouTube.

Import statements:
- `deepmerge` from `../deepmerge`: This is a function that merges multiple objects deeply.
- `JiraProject` from `types`: This is a type definition for a Jira project.
- `User`, `AppSettings`, `Organization`, `ConfluenceSpaceSetting`, `SlackChannelSetting` from `types`: These are type definitions for various settings and entities in the application.
- `getUserClients` from `./getUserClients`: This is a function that retrieves user clients for Jira, Confluence, and Slack.
- `SYSTEM_SETTINGS` from `./SYSTEM_SETTINGS`: This is an object containing system settings.

Internal Functions:
- `buildSettings`: This is the main function that builds the settings for a user. It takes a `user` object and an optional `org` object as parameters. It retrieves the user clients for Jira, Confluence, and Slack using the `getUserClients` function. It then merges the user and organization settings with the system settings using the `deepmerge` function. It makes API calls to retrieve additional data for Jira, Slack, and Confluence and adds them to the settings object. Finally, it adds default settings for other modules like Airtable, Zoom, and YouTube. The function returns the new settings object.

External Functions:
- `getUserClients`: This function takes a `user` object as a parameter and returns an object with Jira, Confluence, and Slack clients.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with other modules and APIs to retrieve user information and client connections. It merges settings from different sources and makes API calls to retrieve additional data for specific modules. The resulting settings object can be used by other parts of the application to configure various modules and functionalities.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the settings for a specific module?
- How can I add additional default settings for other modules?
- How can I handle errors when making API calls to retrieve data for specific modules?
- How can I ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access certain modules or data?
