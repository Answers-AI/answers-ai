Summary:
This code is a script that builds settings for a user in an application. It imports various modules and functions to retrieve user information and client connections. It then merges the user and organization settings with system settings to create a new settings object. The script also makes API calls to retrieve additional data for specific modules like Jira, Slack, and Confluence. Finally, it adds some hardcoded settings for Airtable, Zoom, and YouTube. The script returns the new settings object.

Import statements:
- `deepmerge` from `../deepmerge`: This is a function that merges multiple objects deeply.
- `JiraProject` from `types`: This is a type definition for a Jira project.
- `User`, `AppSettings`, `Organization`, `ConfluenceSpaceSetting`, `SlackChannelSetting` from `types`: These are type definitions for various settings and entities.
- `getUserClients` from `./getUserClients`: This is a function that retrieves user clients for Jira, Confluence, and Slack.
- `SYSTEM_SETTINGS` from `./SYSTEM_SETTINGS`: This is an object containing system settings.

Internal Functions:
- `buildSettings`: This is the main function that builds the settings object. It takes a `user` object and an optional `org` object as parameters. It retrieves user clients for Jira, Confluence, and Slack using the `getUserClients` function. It then merges the user and organization settings with the system settings using the `deepmerge` function. It makes API calls to retrieve additional data for Jira, Slack, and Confluence and adds them to the settings object. Finally, it adds some hardcoded settings for Airtable, Zoom, and YouTube. The function returns the new settings object.

External Functions:
- `getUserClients`: This function takes a `user` object as a parameter and returns an object with Jira, Confluence, and Slack clients.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with other modules and APIs to retrieve user information, client connections, and additional data for specific modules like Jira, Slack, and Confluence. It merges the user and organization settings with system settings and returns the new settings object.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the settings object to include additional modules or settings?
- How can I handle errors when making API calls to retrieve additional data?
- How can I add more hardcoded settings for other modules or APIs?
- How can I optimize the script to reduce redundant API calls or improve performance?
