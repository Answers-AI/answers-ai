Summary:
This code is a module that handles the synchronization of application settings for a user. It includes functions to update the settings for a user and an organization. The module relies on the "types" module for type definitions, the "prisma" module for database operations, and the "buildSettings" and "SYSTEM_SETTINGS" modules for building and retrieving application settings.

Import statements:
- "types": This module provides type definitions for the User and Organization objects.
- "prisma": This module provides access to the Prisma database client for performing database operations.
- "buildSettings": This module contains a function for building application settings.
- "SYSTEM_SETTINGS": This module contains a constant for default system settings.

Script Summary:
The script exports a function called "syncAppSettings" that takes in a userId and an optional organizationId. It first checks if the userId is provided, and if not, it logs a message and returns the default system settings. If the userId is provided, it retrieves the user object from the database using the Prisma client. If the user does not have any organizations associated with them, a new organization is created and linked to the user. The user's settings are then updated using the "updateUserSettings" function. Finally, the updated settings are returned.

Internal Functions:
- "updateUserSettings": This function takes in a user object and updates the user's application settings in the database. It first builds the application settings using the "buildSettings" function and then updates the user object in the database with the new settings. The updated settings are returned.
- "updateOrgSettings": This function takes in a user object and an organization object and updates the organization's application settings in the database. It first builds the application settings using the "buildSettings" function and then updates the user object in the database with the new settings. The updated settings are returned.

External Functions:
- "syncAppSettings": This function takes in a userId and an optional organizationId. It checks if the userId is provided and returns the default system settings if not. It retrieves the user object from the database and creates a new organization if the user does not have any organizations associated with them. It then calls the "updateUserSettings" function to update the user's settings and returns the updated settings.

Interaction Summary:
This module interacts with the Prisma database client to perform database operations. It also relies on the "buildSettings" module to build application settings. The module can be used to synchronize application settings for a user and an organization.

Developer Questions:
- How are the application settings built using the "buildSettings" function?
- What are the possible scenarios where the default system settings are returned?
- How are the user's settings updated in the database?
- How are the organization's settings updated in the database?
- What are the potential issues with this code and how can they be addressed?
