Summary:
This code is a module that handles the synchronization of application settings for a user. It includes functions to update the settings for a user and an organization. The module relies on the "types" module for type definitions, the "prisma" module for database operations, and the "buildSettings" and "SYSTEM_SETTINGS" modules for building and retrieving application settings.

Import statements:
- "types": This module provides type definitions for the User and Organization objects.
- "prisma": This module provides access to the Prisma database client for performing database operations.
- "buildSettings": This module contains a function for building application settings based on user and organization data.
- "SYSTEM_SETTINGS": This module contains a constant that represents the default system settings.

Script Summary:
The script exports a function called "syncAppSettings" that takes in a userId and an optional organizationId. It first checks if the userId is provided, and if not, it logs a message and returns the default system settings. If the userId is provided, it retrieves the user data from the database using Prisma, including the user's accounts, organizations, current organization, and context fields. If the user does not have any organizations, it creates a new organization with the user as a member and updates the user's current organization. It then calls the "updateUserSettings" function to update the user's application settings and returns the updated settings. If the user does not exist, it returns the default system settings.

The "updateUserSettings" function takes in a user object and builds the application settings using the "buildSettings" function. It then updates the user's appSettings field in the database and returns the updated settings.

The "updateOrgSettings" function takes in a user object and an organization object and follows a similar process as "updateUserSettings" to update the organization's application settings. It also checks for the user's role to ensure they have permission to update the organization settings.

Internal Functions:
- updateUserSettings(user: User): This function updates the user's application settings based on the provided user object. It builds the settings using the "buildSettings" function, updates the user's appSettings field in the database, and returns the updated settings.

- updateOrgSettings(user: User, org: Organization): This function updates the organization's application settings based on the provided user and organization objects. It builds the settings using the "buildSettings" function, updates the user's appSettings field in the database, and returns the updated settings.

External Functions:
- syncAppSettings({ userId, organizationId }): This function synchronizes the application settings for a user. It takes in a userId and an optional organizationId. It first checks if the userId is provided, and if not, it logs a message and returns the default system settings. If the userId is provided, it retrieves the user data from the database using Prisma, including the user's accounts, organizations, current organization, and context fields. If the user does not have any organizations, it creates a new organization with the user as a member and updates the user's current organization. It then calls the "updateUserSettings" function to update the user's application settings and returns the updated settings. If the user does not exist, it returns the default system settings.

Interaction Summary:
This module interacts with the Prisma database client to retrieve and update user and organization data. It also relies on the "buildSettings" module to build application settings based on user and organization data. The module can be used to synchronize and update application settings for a user and an organization.

Developer Questions:
- How are the application settings built using the "buildSettings" function?
- What happens if the user does not have any organizations?
- How can the module be extended to support additional functionality or settings?
- How can the module be integrated into the broader software application?
