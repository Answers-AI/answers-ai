Summary:
This code is a script that handles the authentication of an API key. It is responsible for verifying the validity of the API key and returning the corresponding user or organization associated with the key. The script uses the Prisma ORM to interact with the database.

Import statements:
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is used to interact with the database.
- `ApiKeyType`, `Organization`, and `User` are imported from the `db/generated/prisma-client` module. These are Prisma-generated types that represent the database models.

Script Summary:
The `authenticateApiKey` function is an asynchronous function that takes a `req` parameter of type `Request` and returns a `Promise` of type `AuthenticateApiKeyResult` or `null`. It verifies the API key provided in the request header and returns the corresponding user or organization associated with the key.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `authenticateApiKey`: This function takes a `req` parameter of type `Request` and returns a `Promise` of type `AuthenticateApiKeyResult` or `null`. It verifies the API key provided in the request header and returns the corresponding user or organization associated with the key.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Prisma ORM to query the database and retrieve the API key information. It may be called by other parts of the application that require authentication using API keys.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the authentication logic to support additional types of API keys?
- How can I handle errors or exceptions that occur during the authentication process?
- How can I add logging or auditing to track API key usage?
- How can I improve the performance of the authentication process when dealing with a large number of API keys?
