Summary:
This code is a module that provides a class called `OpenApiClient` for fetching data from an OpenAPI endpoint. It includes a function called `blobToString` for converting a Blob object to a string. The class has a method called `fetchOpenApiData` that handles the fetching of data from the OpenAPI endpoint, with an optional caching mechanism using Redis.

Import statements:
- `axios` is imported to make HTTP requests to the OpenAPI endpoint.
- `ResponseType` is imported from `axios` to define the expected response type.
- `redis` is imported from a local file to interact with a Redis cache.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called `OpenApiClient` and exports it as the default export. The class has a constructor that initializes default values for the cache expiration time and headers. It also has a method called `fetchOpenApiData` that fetches data from the OpenAPI endpoint, with an optional caching mechanism using Redis.

Internal Functions:
- `blobToString`: This function takes a Blob object as input and returns a Promise that resolves to a string. It uses the `arrayBuffer` method of the Blob object to get the buffer, and then decodes the buffer using a TextDecoder.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application to fetch data from an OpenAPI endpoint. The `fetchOpenApiData` method can be called with the URL of the endpoint and an optional `cache` parameter to enable or disable caching of the fetched data. The fetched data is returned as the result of the method.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `OpenApiClient` class to fetch data from an OpenAPI endpoint?
- How do I enable or disable caching of the fetched data?
- How do I handle different response types (JSON, YAML, text, blob)?
- How do I handle errors when fetching data from the OpenAPI endpoint?
- How do I configure the cache expiration time?
- How do I configure the headers for the HTTP request?
- How do I handle HTTP requests that are not GET requests?
