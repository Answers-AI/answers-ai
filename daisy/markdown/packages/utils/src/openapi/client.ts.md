Summary:
This code is a module that provides a class called `OpenApiClient` for fetching data from an OpenAPI endpoint. It includes a function called `blobToString` for converting a Blob object to a string. The class has a method called `fetchOpenApiData` that handles the fetching of data from the OpenAPI endpoint, with an optional caching mechanism using Redis.

Import statements:
- `axios` is imported to make HTTP requests to the OpenAPI endpoint.
- `ResponseType` is imported from `axios` to specify the expected response type.
- `redis` is imported from a local file to interact with a Redis cache.

Script Summary:
The script exports a class called `OpenApiClient` and a function called `blobToString`. The class has a constructor that initializes default values for cache expiration time and headers. It also has a method called `fetchOpenApiData` that fetches data from the OpenAPI endpoint, with an optional caching mechanism.

Internal Functions:
- `blobToString`: This function takes a Blob object as input and returns a Promise that resolves to a string. It uses the `arrayBuffer` method of the Blob object to get the buffer, and then decodes the buffer using a TextDecoder to get the string representation.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application to fetch data from an OpenAPI endpoint. The `OpenApiClient` class provides a convenient way to make the API requests and handle caching if needed.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `OpenApiClient` class to fetch data from an OpenAPI endpoint?
- How can I enable or disable caching when using the `fetchOpenApiData` method?
- How can I modify the headers sent with the API request?
- How can I handle different response types (JSON, YAML, text, blob) when using the `fetchOpenApiData` method?
- How can I handle errors or failed API requests when using the `fetchOpenApiData` method?

Known Issues or Bugs:
- There is a custom implementation of caching using Redis, which suggests that there might be an issue with the existing caching solution (`axios-cache-adapter`). The code includes a TODO comment to remove the custom implementation when the issue is fixed.
- There is a catch block that logs a warning message when there is no Redis connection, but it does not handle the error or provide an alternative caching mechanism. This could be improved by implementing a fallback caching solution or handling the error more gracefully.
