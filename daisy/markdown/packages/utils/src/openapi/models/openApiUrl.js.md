Summary:
The given code is a JavaScript module that defines a class called "WebPage" which extends another class called "WebObject". The purpose of this script is to create a representation of a web page object, with properties such as URL, content, and metadata. The script also includes a helper function called "createContext" which is used to generate a string representation of the web page object.

Import statements:
- The code imports the "WebObject" class from a file called "webObject.js". This indicates that the "WebPage" class is dependent on the functionality provided by the "WebObject" class.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called "WebPage" which extends the "WebObject" class. The constructor of the "WebPage" class takes a "webPage" object as a parameter and initializes the "tidiedPage" variable by calling the "tidy" static method of the "WebPage" class. The "tidy" method extracts the URL and HTML content from the "webPage" object and creates a new object with properties such as "text" and "objectType". The "tidiedPage" object is then passed to the constructor of the "WebObject" class using the "super" keyword. Finally, the constructor sets additional properties of the "WebPage" object such as "uid" and "url".

Internal Functions:
- tidy(webPage): This static method takes a "webPage" object as a parameter and returns a tidied version of the object. It extracts the URL and HTML content from the "webPage" object and creates a new object with properties such as "text" and "objectType". The "text" property is generated by calling the "createContext" function.

External Functions:
- createContext(id, metadata): This function takes an "id" and a "metadata" object as parameters and returns a string representation of the metadata. It concatenates the "id" with the metadata properties and values using a template string. The function filters out any properties with falsy values and joins the remaining properties with commas. The resulting string is then returned.

Interaction Summary:
The "WebPage" class can be used as a component within a larger software application to represent web page objects. It can be instantiated with a "webPage" object and provides methods and properties to access and manipulate the data associated with the web page.

Developer Questions:
- How can I create an instance of the "WebPage" class?
- What properties does the "WebPage" class have?
- How can I access the URL or content of a "WebPage" object?
- How can I modify the metadata of a "WebPage" object?
- How can I convert a "WebPage" object to a string representation?
