Summary:
The given code is a JavaScript module that defines a class called "WebPage" which extends another class called "WebObject". The purpose of this script is to create a representation of a web page object, with properties such as URL, content, and metadata. The script also includes a helper function called "createContext" which is used to generate a string representation of the web page object.

Import statements:
- The code imports the "WebObject" class from a file called "webObject.js". This indicates that the "WebPage" class is dependent on the functionality provided by the "WebObject" class.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called "WebPage" which extends the "WebObject" class. The constructor of the "WebPage" class takes a "webPage" object as a parameter and initializes the "tidiedPage" variable by calling the "tidy" static method of the "WebPage" class. The "tidy" method extracts the URL and HTML content from the "webPage" object and creates a new object with properties such as "text" and "objectType". The "tidiedPage" object is then passed to the constructor of the "WebObject" class using the "super" keyword. Additional properties such as "uid", "url", and "objectType" are set on the "this.object" property of the "WebObject" instance.

The script also defines a static method called "tidy" within the "WebPage" class. This method takes a "webPage" object as a parameter and extracts the URL and HTML content from it. It then creates a new object with properties such as "objectType", "url", and "content". The "content" property is generated by calling the "webToMarkdown" method of the "WebObject" class, which converts the HTML content to Markdown format. The "tidy" method returns the created object.

The script also includes a helper function called "createContext" which takes an "id" and "metadata" object as parameters. It initializes a "string" variable with the value of "id" and then appends key-value pairs from the "metadata" object to the "string" variable. The key-value pairs are filtered to exclude any falsy values and are joined together with commas. The resulting string is then returned.

External Functions:
- createContext(id, metadata): This function takes an "id" (presumably a unique identifier) and a "metadata" object as parameters. It creates a string representation of the "metadata" object by appending key-value pairs to the "string" variable. The resulting string is returned.

Internal Functions:
- tidy(webPage): This static method takes a "webPage" object as a parameter. It extracts the URL and HTML content from the "webPage" object and creates a new object with properties such as "objectType", "url", and "content". The "content" property is generated by calling the "webToMarkdown" method of the "WebObject" class. The created object is returned.

Interaction Summary:
The "WebPage" class extends the "WebObject" class, indicating that it inherits functionality from the parent class. The "WebPage" class can be used to create instances of web page objects with properties such as URL, content, and metadata. The "createContext" function can be used to generate a string representation of a web page object.

Developer Questions:
- How can I create a new instance of the "WebPage" class?
- What properties are available on the "WebPage" class?
- How can I access the URL or content of a web page object?
- How can I modify the "createContext" function to include additional metadata properties?
- How can I use the "WebPage" class in conjunction with other parts of the application?
