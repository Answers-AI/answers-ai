Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that exports a single function called `getOpenApiJson`. The function is responsible for fetching OpenAPI JSON data from a specified URL using an external `openApiClient` module. It returns a Promise that resolves to the fetched OpenAPI JSON data.

Import statements:
- `openApiClient` is imported from the `index` module. It is used to fetch OpenAPI JSON data from a URL.
- `OpenAPIV3` is imported from the `openapi-types` module. It provides TypeScript types for OpenAPI v3 specifications.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single function called `getOpenApiJson`. This function takes an object as a parameter with a `url` property. It logs a message indicating that it is fetching OpenAPI data from the specified URL. It then calls the `fetchOpenApiData` function from the `openApiClient` module, passing the URL and an options object with `cache` set to `false`. If the fetched JSON data is not valid, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the fetched JSON data is returned.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `getOpenApiJson`: This function takes an object as a parameter with a `url` property. It is an async function that returns a Promise that resolves to an OpenAPI v3 document. It logs a message indicating that it is fetching OpenAPI data from the specified URL. It then calls the `fetchOpenApiData` function from the `openApiClient` module, passing the URL and an options object with `cache` set to `false`. If the fetched JSON data is not valid, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the fetched JSON data is returned.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the `openApiClient` module to fetch OpenAPI JSON data from a specified URL. It does not have any direct interaction with other modules or components.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the `getOpenApiJson` function to handle caching of the fetched JSON data?
- What happens if the `openApiClient.fetchOpenApiData` function throws an error? How can I handle it?
- Can I use this script to fetch OpenAPI JSON data from a local file instead of a URL?
