Summary:
This code is a JavaScript module that exports a function called `getJiraTickets`. The purpose of this function is to retrieve Jira tickets from a Jira server using a provided JQL (Jira Query Language) query. The function makes use of the `JiraClient` class to interact with the Jira server and fetch the tickets. The function returns a promise that resolves to an array of `JiraIssue` objects.

Import statements:
- `JiraIssue` is imported from the 'types' module. This module likely contains type definitions for Jira issues.
- `JiraClient` is imported from the './client' module. This module likely contains the implementation of the Jira client used to interact with the Jira server.

Script Summary:
The script exports a function called `getJiraTickets` that takes in an object as its parameter. This object contains the `jiraClient` (an instance of the `JiraClient` class), the JQL query (`jql`), and optional parameters for pagination (`startAt` and `maxResults`). The function makes use of the `jiraClient` to fetch Jira tickets from the server based on the provided JQL query. It uses pagination to retrieve all the tickets in batches. The function returns a promise that resolves to an array of `JiraIssue` objects.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `getJiraTickets`: This function takes in an object parameter with properties `jiraClient`, `jql`, `startAt`, and `maxResults`. It makes use of the `jiraClient` to fetch Jira tickets from the server based on the provided JQL query. It uses pagination to retrieve all the tickets in batches. The function returns a promise that resolves to an array of `JiraIssue` objects.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Jira server by making API calls using the `JiraClient` class. It fetches Jira tickets based on the provided JQL query and returns the retrieved tickets as an array of `JiraIssue` objects. This script can be used as a module in a larger software application that requires integration with Jira.
