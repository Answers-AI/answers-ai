Summary:
This code defines a class called JiraComment that extends another class called JiraObject. The JiraComment class is responsible for creating and manipulating JIRA comments. It includes a constructor method, a static method for tidying up comment data, and a helper function for creating a context string. The JiraComment class inherits properties and methods from the JiraObject class.

Import statements:
- `import JiraObject from './jiraObject';`: This imports the JiraObject class from a file called 'jiraObject.js'. The './' indicates that the file is in the same directory as the current file.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called JiraComment that extends the JiraObject class. It has a constructor method that takes a comment object as a parameter and initializes the JiraComment object with tidied comment data. The constructor also sets the object type and unique identifier properties of the JiraComment object.

The script also defines a static method called `tidy` that takes a comment object as a parameter and returns a tidied version of the comment. The method removes unnecessary properties from the comment object, adds additional properties, and converts the comment body from JIRA ADF format to Markdown format.

There is a helper function called `createContext` that takes metadata as a parameter and returns a context string. The function constructs a string using the metadata properties and returns it.

Finally, the JiraComment class is exported as the default export of the module.

Internal Functions:
- `tidy(comment)`: This static method takes a comment object as a parameter and returns a tidied version of the comment. It removes unnecessary properties from the comment object, adds additional properties, and converts the comment body from JIRA ADF format to Markdown format. It returns the tidied comment object.

- `createContext(metadata)`: This function takes metadata as a parameter and returns a context string. It constructs a string using the metadata properties and returns it.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
The JiraComment class can be used to create and manipulate JIRA comments within the broader software application. It extends the JiraObject class, which suggests that it may have additional functionality related to JIRA objects.

Developer Questions:
- How can I create a new JiraComment object?
- How can I access the tidied version of a comment?
- How can I convert a JIRA ADF formatted comment body to Markdown format?
- How can I create a context string for a comment?
