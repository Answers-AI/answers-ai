Summary:
This code defines a class called JiraComment that extends another class called JiraObject. The JiraComment class is responsible for creating and manipulating JIRA comments. It includes a constructor method, a static method for tidying up comment data, and a helper function for creating a context string. The JiraComment class is exported as the default export of the module.

Import statements:
- `import JiraObject from './jiraObject';`: This imports the JiraObject class from a file called 'jiraObject.js' in the same directory.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called JiraComment that extends the JiraObject class. It has a constructor method that takes a comment object as a parameter, tidies up the comment data using the static `tidy` method, and sets the object type and UID properties. The `tidy` method is a static method that takes a comment object as a parameter, performs some data manipulation, and returns a tidied up version of the comment object. The script also includes a helper function called `createContext` that takes metadata as a parameter and creates a context string based on the metadata. Finally, the JiraComment class is exported as the default export of the module.

Internal Functions:
- `tidy(comment)`: This static method takes a comment object as a parameter and tidies up the comment data by manipulating the object properties. It creates a new object with the tidied up properties and returns it.

External Functions:
- `createContext(metadata)`: This function takes metadata as a parameter and creates a context string based on the metadata. It concatenates various properties of the metadata object to form the context string and returns it.

Interaction Summary:
The JiraComment class extends the JiraObject class, indicating that it is a specialized version of the JiraObject class specifically for JIRA comments. It uses the `tidy` method to clean up comment data and the `createContext` function to generate a context string. The JiraComment class can be used to create and manipulate JIRA comments within a broader software application.

Developer Questions:
- How can I create a new JiraComment object?
- What properties does a JiraComment object have?
- How can I access the tidied up comment data?
- How can I generate a context string for a JIRA comment?
- How does the JiraComment class interact with the JiraObject class?
