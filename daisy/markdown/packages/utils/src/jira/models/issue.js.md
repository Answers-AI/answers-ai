Summary:
The code provided is a module that defines a class called JiraIssue, which extends another class called JiraObject. The JiraIssue class is responsible for representing a JIRA issue and provides methods for manipulating and accessing its properties. The code also includes a helper function called createContext, which is used to create a text representation of the JIRA issue.

Import statements:
- `import JiraObject from './jiraObject';`: This imports the JiraObject class from a file called 'jiraObject.js'. It is used as the base class for the JiraIssue class.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called JiraIssue, which extends the JiraObject class. The JiraIssue class has a constructor that takes an issue object as a parameter. It calls the `tidy` static method to clean up the issue object and then calls the constructor of the base class (JiraObject) with the tidied issue object. It also sets some additional properties specific to JIRA issues.

The `tidy` static method takes an issue object as a parameter and extracts relevant information from it. It returns a tidied object with the extracted information.

The script also defines a helper function called `createContext`, which takes an id and metadata object as parameters. It creates a text representation of the JIRA issue by concatenating the id and the metadata properties. It filters out properties with empty values and formats the property names for better readability.

External Functions:
- `JiraIssue.tidy(issue)`: This static method takes an issue object as a parameter and returns a tidied version of the issue object. It extracts relevant information from the issue object and returns a new object with the extracted information.

Internal Functions:
- `createContext(id, metadata)`: This function takes an id and metadata object as parameters and returns a text representation of the JIRA issue. It concatenates the id and the metadata properties, filters out properties with empty values, and formats the property names for better readability.

Interaction Summary:
The JiraIssue class can be used to represent and manipulate JIRA issues within a broader software application. It provides methods for accessing and modifying the properties of a JIRA issue. The class can be extended or modified to add additional functionality specific to the application's needs.

Developer Questions:
- How can I create a new instance of the JiraIssue class?
- How can I access the properties of a JIRA issue using the JiraIssue class?
- How can I modify the properties of a JIRA issue using the JiraIssue class?
- How can I convert a JIRA issue object to a text representation using the createContext function?
