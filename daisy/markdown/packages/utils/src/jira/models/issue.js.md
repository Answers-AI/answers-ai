Summary:
The code provided is a module that defines a class called JiraIssue, which extends another class called JiraObject. The JiraIssue class is responsible for representing a JIRA issue and provides methods for tidying up the issue data and creating a context string. The module exports the JiraIssue class as the default export.

Import statements:
- The code imports the JiraObject class from a file called 'jiraObject'. This suggests that the JiraObject class is defined in a separate module and is a dependency for the JiraIssue class.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called JiraIssue that extends the JiraObject class. It has a constructor that takes an issue object as a parameter. The constructor calls the static tidy() method to clean up the issue data and then calls the constructor of the parent class (JiraObject) with the tidied issue data. It also sets some additional properties specific to JiraIssue. The script also defines a static tidy() method that takes an issue object as a parameter and returns a tidied version of the issue data.

Internal Functions:
- tidy(issue): This static method takes an issue object as a parameter and returns a tidied version of the issue data. It extracts relevant fields from the issue object and maps them to a new object with lowercase keys. It also converts the description field from Jira's ADF format to markdown format. Finally, it returns the tidied object.

External Functions:
- createContext(id, metadata): This function takes an id and a metadata object as parameters and returns a context string. It concatenates the id with the metadata values and formats them into a readable string. It filters out any metadata values that are falsy and joins them with commas. The resulting string is then returned.

Interaction Summary:
The JiraIssue class extends the JiraObject class, suggesting that it inherits behavior and properties from the parent class. It also interacts with the createContext() function to generate a context string for the JiraIssue object.

Developer Questions:
- How does the JiraIssue class relate to the JiraObject class?
- What are the available properties and methods of the JiraIssue class?
- How can I modify the tidying process in the tidy() method?
- How can I customize the format of the context string generated by the createContext() function?
