Summary:
This code defines a class called JiraStatus that extends another class called JiraObject. The JiraStatus class is responsible for creating JIRA status objects and provides a method to tidy up the status object by removing certain fields. The script exports the JiraStatus class as the default export.

Import statements:
- The code imports the JiraObject class from a file called "jiraObject". This suggests that the JiraStatus class is dependent on the JiraObject class for its functionality.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called JiraStatus that extends the JiraObject class. The constructor of the JiraStatus class takes a status object as a parameter. It calls the static tidy() method to clean up the status object by removing certain fields. Then, it calls the constructor of the parent class (JiraObject) with the tidied status object. It also sets some additional properties of the JiraObject instance, such as the object type, status category ID, and UID.

The script also defines a static tidy() method that takes a status object as a parameter. This method removes specific fields from the status object by iterating over an array of field names to be removed.

External Functions:
- None

Internal Functions:
- tidy(status): This static method takes a status object as a parameter and removes specific fields from it. It iterates over an array of field names to be removed and deletes those fields from the status object. It returns the tidied status object.

Interaction Summary:
The JiraStatus class is a component that can be used within a broader software application that deals with JIRA. It extends the JiraObject class and provides functionality to create and tidy up JIRA status objects. Other parts of the application can create instances of the JiraStatus class and use its methods to work with JIRA status data.
