Summary:
This code is a script that fetches URLs from a sitemap of a given domain. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests and the cheerio library to parse XML data. The script consists of three functions: fetchSitemapUrls, parseSitemapUrlsFromRobotsTxt, and parseSitemapUrls. The fetchSitemapUrls function is the main function that orchestrates the fetching and parsing of sitemap URLs. It takes a domain as input and returns a promise that resolves to an array of URLs.

Import statements:
- axios: This library is used to make HTTP requests.
- cheerio: This library is used to parse XML data.

Script Summary:
The script fetches sitemap URLs from a given domain by first fetching the robots.txt file of the domain. It then extracts the sitemap URLs from the robots.txt file and fetches each sitemap XML file. Finally, it parses the sitemap XML files to extract the URLs and returns them as an array.

Internal Functions:
- parseSitemapUrlsFromRobotsTxt: This function takes the content of the robots.txt file as input and returns an array of sitemap URLs. It splits the content into lines, iterates over each line, and checks if it starts with "sitemap:". If it does, it extracts the sitemap URL and adds it to the array.
- parseSitemapUrls: This function takes the content of a sitemap XML file as input and returns an array of URLs. It uses the cheerio library to load the XML content and then selects all "url > loc" elements. It iterates over each element and extracts the text content, which represents a URL, and adds it to the array.

External Functions:
- fetchSitemapUrls: This is the main function of the script. It takes a domain as input and returns a promise that resolves to an array of URLs. It first constructs the URL of the robots.txt file by appending "/robots.txt" to the domain. It then makes an HTTP GET request to fetch the robots.txt file. If the request is successful, it calls the parseSitemapUrlsFromRobotsTxt function to extract the sitemap URLs from the response data. It then iterates over each sitemap URL, makes an HTTP GET request to fetch the sitemap XML file, and calls the parseSitemapUrls function to extract the URLs from the XML data. The extracted URLs are added to the "urls" array. If any error occurs during the process, it is caught and logged to the console.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a standalone utility to fetch sitemap URLs from a given domain. It can also be integrated into a larger software application that requires sitemap data for further processing or analysis.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the script to handle different types of sitemap formats?
- Can I add additional error handling or logging to improve the script's robustness?
- How can I extend the script to perform additional operations on the fetched URLs, such as filtering or sorting?
- Are there any performance optimizations that can be applied to the script, especially when dealing with large sitemaps?
