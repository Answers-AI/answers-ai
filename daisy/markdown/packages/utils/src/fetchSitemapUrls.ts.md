Summary:
This code is a script that fetches sitemap URLs from a given domain. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests and the cheerio library to parse XML data. The script consists of several functions that handle different parts of the process, including fetching the robots.txt file, parsing sitemap URLs from the robots.txt content, and parsing sitemap URLs from XML data.

Import statements:
- axios: This library is used to make HTTP requests.
- cheerio: This library is used to parse XML data.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single function called fetchSitemapUrls, which takes a domain as a parameter and returns a promise that resolves to an array of sitemap URLs. The function fetches the robots.txt file from the given domain, extracts the sitemap URLs from it, and then fetches each sitemap XML file to extract the individual URLs.

Internal Functions:
- parseSitemapUrlsFromRobotsTxt: This function takes the content of the robots.txt file as a parameter and returns an array of sitemap URLs. It splits the content into lines, searches for lines starting with "sitemap:", extracts the sitemap path, and adds it to the array.
- parseSitemapUrls: This function takes the sitemap XML content as a parameter and returns an array of URLs. It uses cheerio to load the XML content, selects all "url > loc" elements, and extracts the text content of each element.

External Functions:
- fetchSitemapUrls: This function takes a domain as a parameter and returns a promise that resolves to an array of sitemap URLs. It fetches the robots.txt file, extracts the sitemap URLs from it using parseSitemapUrlsFromRobotsTxt, fetches each sitemap XML file, and extracts the URLs using parseSitemapUrls. Any errors that occur during the process are caught and logged to the console.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a standalone utility to fetch sitemap URLs from a given domain. It can also be integrated into a larger application that needs to crawl and analyze website data.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify this script to fetch additional information from the sitemap XML files?
- Can I use this script to fetch sitemap URLs from multiple domains simultaneously?
- How can I handle authentication or other request headers when making HTTP requests with axios?
- Are there any limitations or performance considerations when parsing large sitemap XML files?
