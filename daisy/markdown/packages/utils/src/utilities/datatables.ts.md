Summary:
This code is a module that provides utility functions for sorting and comparing data. It includes functions for creating comparators, sorting arrays, and performing descending comparisons. The module exports several functions and types that can be used by other parts of the application.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
This script exports several utility functions for sorting and comparing data. It includes functions for creating comparators, sorting arrays, and performing descending comparisons.

Internal Functions:
1. descendingComparator: This function takes two values, `a` and `b`, and an `orderBy` parameter which specifies the key to compare. It compares the values of `b[orderBy]` and `a[orderBy]` and returns -1 if `b[orderBy]` is less than `a[orderBy]`, 1 if `b[orderBy]` is greater than `a[orderBy]`, and 0 if they are equal.

2. getComparator: This function takes an `order` parameter which specifies the order of sorting ('asc' or 'desc') and an `orderBy` parameter which specifies the key to compare. It returns a comparator function that can be used to compare two objects based on the specified key and order. The returned comparator function uses the `descendingComparator` function internally.

3. stableSort: This function takes an array of values and a comparator function. It creates a new array with each element of the input array paired with its index. It then sorts the new array using the comparator function. If two elements have the same value according to the comparator, their original order is preserved. Finally, the function returns an array containing only the original values, without the indices.

External Functions:
1. descendingComparator: This function is exported and can be used by other parts of the application to perform descending comparisons.

2. getComparator: This function is exported and can be used by other parts of the application to create comparators based on the specified order and key.

3. stableSort: This function is exported and can be used by other parts of the application to sort arrays in a stable manner, preserving the original order of elements with equal values.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application that require sorting and comparing functionality. Other modules can import and use the exported functions to perform sorting operations on arrays of data.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I use the `getComparator` function to create a comparator for a specific key and order?
2. How can I use the `stableSort` function to sort an array of objects based on a specific key and order?
3. How can I use the `descendingComparator` function to perform a descending comparison between two values?
