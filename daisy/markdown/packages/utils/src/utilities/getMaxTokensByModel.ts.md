Summary:
This code snippet is a JavaScript function that returns the maximum number of tokens allowed for a given GPT model. It is a standalone script that can be used as a utility function within a broader software application.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code snippet.

Script Summary:
The script defines a function called `getMaxTokensByModel` that takes an optional parameter `gptModel`. It uses a switch statement to determine the maximum number of tokens allowed based on the value of `gptModel`. If `gptModel` matches one of the specified cases, the corresponding maximum token count is returned. If `gptModel` does not match any of the cases, a default value of 4000 is returned.

Internal Functions:
- `getMaxTokensByModel(gptModel?: string)`: This function takes an optional parameter `gptModel` of type string. It uses a switch statement to determine the maximum number of tokens allowed based on the value of `gptModel`. It returns the maximum token count.

External Functions:
There are no external functions in this code snippet.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility function within a larger software application. Other parts of the application can call the `getMaxTokensByModel` function to retrieve the maximum token count for a given GPT model. The returned value can then be used for various purposes, such as validating input or setting limits on token usage.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use this function in my application?
- What are the possible values for `gptModel`?
- Can I modify the function to add support for additional GPT models?
- Are there any limitations or known issues with this function?
