Summary:
This script is a part of a broader software application and its purpose is to count the number of tokens in a given text using the GPT3Tokenizer library. It exports a single function called "countTokens" which takes a string as input and returns the number of tokens in that string.

Import statements:
- The script imports the GPT3Tokenizer library using the "import" statement. This library is used for tokenizing text using the GPT-3 language model.

Script Summary:
The script defines a function called "countTokens" which takes a string as input and returns the number of tokens in that string. It uses the GPT3Tokenizer library to tokenize the input text and then counts the number of tokens in the resulting encoded text.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- countTokens(text: string): number
  - This function takes a string as input and returns the number of tokens in that string.
  - It first creates an instance of the GPT3Tokenizer class called "tokenizer" with the configuration option "type" set to "gpt3".
  - It then calls the "encode" method of the tokenizer instance, passing the input text as an argument. This method encodes the text into tokens using the GPT-3 language model.
  - The encoded text is stored in a variable called "encoded".
  - The function then retrieves the length of the "bpe" property of the encoded text, which represents the number of tokens in the text.
  - Finally, the function returns the number of tokens.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used by other parts of the application to count the number of tokens in a given text. It exports the "countTokens" function, which can be imported and called from other files.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use the "countTokens" function in my code?
- What is the purpose of the GPT3Tokenizer library and how does it work?
- Are there any limitations or potential issues with tokenizing large texts?
- Can I customize the tokenizer's configuration options?
