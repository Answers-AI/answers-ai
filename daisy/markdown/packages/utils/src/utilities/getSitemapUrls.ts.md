Summary:
This code is a JavaScript module that extracts URLs from a sitemap. It uses the axios library to make HTTP requests and the cheerio library to parse HTML. The main function, `extractUrlsFromSitemap`, takes a sitemap URL as input and returns an array of all URLs listed in the sitemap, including those listed in any nested sitemaps.

Import statements:
- `axios`: This library is used to make HTTP requests.
- `cheerio`: This library is used to parse HTML.

Script Summary:
The script defines a single function, `extractUrlsFromSitemap`, which takes a sitemap URL as input and returns an array of URLs. It uses the axios library to make an HTTP GET request to the sitemap URL and retrieves the sitemap data. The data is then parsed using cheerio, and the URLs are extracted from the sitemap. If a URL ends with ".xml", it is assumed to be a nested sitemap, and the function recursively calls itself to extract URLs from the nested sitemap. The extracted URLs are stored in an array and returned.

Internal Functions:
- `extractUrlsFromSitemap`: This function takes a sitemap URL as input and returns an array of URLs. It makes an HTTP GET request to the sitemap URL using axios, retrieves the sitemap data, and parses it using cheerio. It then iterates over the "loc" elements in the sitemap, extracts the URLs, and adds them to the result array. If a URL ends with ".xml", it is assumed to be a nested sitemap, and the function recursively calls itself to extract URLs from the nested sitemap. If an error occurs during the process, it is caught and logged to the console, and an empty array is returned.

External Functions:
- `extractUrlsFromSitemap`: This function is exported and can be used by other modules. It takes a sitemap URL as input and returns a promise that resolves to an array of URLs.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used by other modules or scripts to extract URLs from sitemaps. It can be called with a sitemap URL, and it will return a promise that resolves to an array of URLs. This functionality can be useful in web scraping, SEO analysis, or any other application that requires extracting URLs from sitemaps.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use this script to extract URLs from a sitemap?
- What happens if the sitemap URL is invalid or the request fails?
- How can I handle errors that occur during the extraction process?
- Can I modify this script to extract additional information from the sitemap, such as last modified dates or priority values?
- How can I optimize this script for performance when processing large sitemaps?
