Summary:
This code defines a class called "Vector" and exports it as the default export. The Vector class is used to create vector objects with an id, metadata, and values. The class also includes static methods for removing null and undefined values from objects and flattening nested objects.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
This script defines a class called Vector and exports it as the default export. The Vector class has a constructor that takes an id, metadata, and values as parameters. It also includes static methods for removing null and undefined values from objects and flattening nested objects.

Internal Functions:
- removeObjNulls(obj): This static method takes an object as a parameter and returns a new object with null and undefined values removed. It uses the Object.entries() method to convert the object into an array of key-value pairs, filters out the pairs with null or undefined values, and then uses Object.fromEntries() to convert the filtered array back into an object. The method is used in the flattenObject() method.
- flattenObject(ob): This static method takes an object as a parameter and returns a new object with flattened keys. It recursively iterates over the object and checks if each property is an object. If it is, it recursively calls itself on the nested object and appends the flattened keys to the new object. If the property is not an object, it adds it to the new object as is. The method also uses the removeObjNulls() method to remove null and undefined values from the new object. The method is used in the constructor to flatten the metadata object.

External Functions:
There are no external functions in this code.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used to create vector objects with an id, metadata, and values. The Vector class can be imported and instantiated in other parts of the application to create and manipulate vectors.

Developer Questions:
- How do I create a vector object using the Vector class?
- How do I access the id, metadata, and values of a vector object?
- How do I remove null and undefined values from an object?
- How do I flatten a nested object and convert it into a new object with flattened keys?
