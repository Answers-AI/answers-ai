Summary:
This code is a script that fetches context data based on a given prompt and filters. It uses the Pinecone database to query for relevant data and applies various filters to refine the results. The script also handles rendering the context string and counting tokens to ensure it stays within the maximum token limit. The fetched context data is returned along with any associated documents.

Import statements:
- `PineconeClient` from `@pinecone-database/pinecone`: This is the client library for interacting with the Pinecone database.
- `pineconeQuery` from `./pineconeQuery`: This is a custom function for querying the Pinecone database.
- `prisma` from `@db/client`: This is the Prisma client for interacting with the database.
- `OpenAIClient` from `../openai/openai`: This is the client library for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- Various utility functions and types from different files.

Script Summary:
The script fetches context data based on a given prompt and filters. It parses the filters, creates an embedding for the prompt, applies the filters to query the Pinecone database, filters the results based on relevance threshold, renders the context string, counts tokens, and returns the fetched context data along with associated documents.

Internal Functions:
- `parseFilters(filters: AnswersFilters)`: This function parses the filters object and modifies it to match the expected format for querying the Pinecone database.
- `filterPineconeDataRelevanceThreshhold(data: any[], threshold: number)`: This function filters the data based on a relevance threshold and sorts it by score.

External Functions:
- `fetchContext(params: FetchContextParams)`: This function is the main entry point of the script. It fetches context data based on the provided parameters. It parses the filters, creates an embedding for the prompt, applies the filters to query the Pinecone database, filters the results based on relevance threshold, renders the context string, counts tokens, and returns the fetched context data along with associated documents.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Pinecone database, the Prisma database, and the OpenAI API. It fetches context data from the Pinecone database based on the provided prompt and filters. It also interacts with the Prisma database to fetch associated documents. The OpenAI API is used for creating embeddings and rendering the context string.

Developer Questions:
- How are the filters parsed and modified to match the expected format for querying the Pinecone database?
- How is the relevance threshold applied to filter the fetched data?
- How is the context string rendered and token count calculated?
- How are the associated documents fetched from the Prisma database?
- How is the prompt embedding created and used in the Pinecone query?
