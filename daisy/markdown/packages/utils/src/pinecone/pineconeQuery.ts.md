Summary:
This code is a module that provides functions for querying a Pinecone database and an OpenAI API. It initializes the OpenAI API and exports the initialized instance as `openai`. It also exports a function `pineconeQuery` that takes in embeddings and query parameters, performs a query on a Pinecone database, and returns the query result.

Import statements:
- `openai` and `Configuration` are imported from the 'openai' module. These are used to initialize the OpenAI API.
- `AnswersFilters` is imported from the 'types' module. This is used as a type for the `filter` parameter in the `pineconeQuery` function.
- `PineconeClient` and `QueryRequest` are imported from the '@pinecone-database/pinecone' module. These are used to interact with the Pinecone database.

Script Summary:
The script initializes the OpenAI API and exports the initialized instance as `openai`. It also exports a function `pineconeQuery` that performs a query on a Pinecone database using the PineconeClient and QueryRequest classes.

Internal Functions:
- `initializeOpenAI`: This function initializes the OpenAI API by creating a Configuration instance with the API key from the environment variables. It returns a new OpenAIApi instance.

External Functions:
- `pineconeQuery`: This function takes in embeddings (an array of numbers) and query parameters (an object with optional `filter`, `topK`, and `namespace` properties). It performs a query on a Pinecone database using the PineconeClient and QueryRequest classes. It returns the query result.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application to perform queries on a Pinecone database and interact with the OpenAI API.

Developer Questions:
- How do I initialize the OpenAI API?
- How do I perform a query on a Pinecone database using this module?
- What are the required and optional parameters for the `pineconeQuery` function?
- How do I handle errors when performing a query on a Pinecone database?
