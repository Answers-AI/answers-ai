Summary:
This code is a script that is responsible for embedding vectors into a Pinecone index. It takes in an organization ID, an event object, and an array of vectors as input. It chunks the vectors into batches and sends them to the Pinecone ingest API using the `inngest.send()` function. The script returns an array of void values.

Import statements:
- `inngest` is imported from the `../ingest/client` module. It is likely a custom client for interacting with the Pinecone ingest API.
- `chunkArray` is imported from the `../utilities/utils` module. It is likely a utility function for splitting an array into smaller chunks.
- `PineconeVector` is imported from the `types` module. It is likely a type definition for the vectors being embedded.

Script Summary:
The script defines a constant `PINECONE_VECTORS_BATCH_SIZE` with a value of 100. It then exports a default function `embedVectors` that takes in an organization ID, an event object, and an array of vectors. Inside the function, it initializes an empty array `outVectors`. It checks if the `vectors` array is not empty and every element in it is truthy. If the condition is true, it proceeds to send the vectors to the Pinecone ingest API in batches using the `inngest.send()` function. The function uses the `chunkArray` utility function to split the vectors into batches of size `PINECONE_VECTORS_BATCH_SIZE`. It maps over the batches and sends each batch to the API. The function returns the array of void values.

Internal Functions:
- `embedVectors`: This function takes in an organization ID, an event object, and an array of vectors. It sends the vectors to the Pinecone ingest API in batches and returns an array of void values.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Pinecone ingest API by sending batches of vectors to be embedded into the index. It requires an organization ID and an event object to be passed in as parameters.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the `inngest` client and how is it configured?
- How are the vectors being generated and passed into the `embedVectors` function?
- What is the structure of the `event` object and what properties does it require?
- How is the `chunkArray` utility function implemented and what is its purpose?
- Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for failed API requests?
- How can the batch size for sending vectors be modified?
- Can this script be used for embedding vectors into multiple indexes simultaneously?
