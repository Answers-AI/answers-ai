Summary:
This code is a script that is responsible for embedding vectors into a Pinecone index. It takes in an organization ID, an event object, and an array of vectors as input. It chunks the vectors into batches and sends them to the Pinecone ingest API using the `inngest.send()` function. The script returns an array of void values.

Import statements:
- `inngest` is imported from the `../ingest/client` module. It is likely a custom client for interacting with the Pinecone ingest API.
- `chunkArray` is imported from the `../utilities/utils` module. It is likely a utility function for splitting an array into smaller chunks.
- `PineconeVector` is imported from the `types` module. It is likely a type definition for the vector data structure.

Script Summary:
The script defines a constant `PINECONE_VECTORS_BATCH_SIZE` with a value of 100. It then exports a default function `embedVectors` that takes in an organization ID, an event object, and an array of vectors. Inside the function, it initializes an empty array `outVectors`. It checks if the `vectors` array is not empty and every element in it is truthy. If the condition is true, it proceeds to send the vectors to the Pinecone ingest API in batches using the `inngest.send()` function. The function uses the `chunkArray` utility function to split the vectors into batches of size `PINECONE_VECTORS_BATCH_SIZE`. It also includes some metadata in the payload such as the page number, total number of vectors, batch size, organization ID, and user information from the `event` object. The function uses `Promise.all()` to await the completion of all the API requests and assigns the resulting array of void values to `outVectors`. Finally, the function returns `outVectors`.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `embedVectors(organizationId: string, event: any, vectors: PineconeVector[]): Promise<void[]>`: This function takes in an organization ID (string), an event object (any), and an array of vectors (PineconeVector[]). It sends the vectors to the Pinecone ingest API in batches and returns an array of void values.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Pinecone ingest API through the `inngest.send()` function. It also uses the `chunkArray` utility function to split the vectors into batches. The script expects to receive an organization ID, an event object, and an array of vectors as input.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of embedding vectors into a Pinecone index?
- How are the vectors generated or obtained?
- What is the structure of the `event` object?
- How does the `inngest.send()` function work and what is its expected response?
- Are there any limitations or constraints on the size or format of the vectors?
- How can the batch size be adjusted if needed?
- Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for failed API requests?
- How can the script be integrated into the broader software application?
