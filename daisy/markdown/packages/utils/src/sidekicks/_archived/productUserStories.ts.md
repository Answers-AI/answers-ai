Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a sales object that represents a sidekick in a software application. The sales object contains various properties and methods related to user stories and acceptance criteria. This script plays a role in providing a template or blueprint for creating and managing user stories and acceptance criteria within the broader software application.

Script Structure:
The script starts with an import statement for the Sidekick type from the 'types' module. It then defines a constant variable named 'sales' which is an object of type Sidekick. The object has several properties such as departments, label, value, temperature, frequency, presence, maxCompletionTokens, placeholder, getSystemPromptTemplate, getUserPromptTemplate, and contextStringRender. Finally, the 'sales' object is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
- The import statement imports the Sidekick type from the 'types' module. This type is used to define the type of the 'sales' object.
