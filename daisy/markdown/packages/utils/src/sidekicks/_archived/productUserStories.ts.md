Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a sales object that represents a sidekick in a software application. The sales object contains various properties and methods related to user stories and acceptance criteria. This script plays a role in providing a template or blueprint for creating and managing user stories and acceptance criteria within the broader software application.

Script Structure:
The script starts with an import statement for the Sidekick type from the 'types' module. It then defines a constant variable named 'sales' which is an object of type Sidekick. The object has several properties such as departments, label, value, temperature, frequency, presence, maxCompletionTokens, placeholder, getSystemPromptTemplate, getUserPromptTemplate, and contextStringRender. Finally, the 'sales' object is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
- The import statement imports the Sidekick type from the 'types' module. This type is likely defined in a separate file and is used to ensure type safety and consistency when working with sidekick objects.

Classes and Functions:
- There are no classes defined in this script. Instead, the script defines an object literal named 'sales' with various properties and methods.

Properties:
- departments: An array of strings representing the departments associated with the sidekick.
- label: A string representing the label or name of the sidekick.
- value: A string representing the value associated with the sidekick.
- temperature: A number representing the temperature of the sidekick.
- frequency: A number representing the frequency of the sidekick.
- presence: A number representing the presence of the sidekick.
- maxCompletionTokens: A number representing the maximum completion tokens for the sidekick.
- placeholder: A string representing the placeholder text for the sidekick.

Methods:
- getSystemPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template. It does not take any parameters and always returns the same string.
- getUserPromptTemplate: A function that takes two parameters (query and context) and returns a string representing a user prompt template. The function interpolates the query and context parameters into the returned string.
- contextStringRender: A function that takes a context parameter and returns a string representing the rendered context. The function interpolates the filePath and text properties of the context parameter into the returned string.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
There are no loops or conditional statements in this script.

Variable Usage:
- The script uses the 'sales' variable to define and export the sales object. The sales object contains various properties and methods related to user stories and acceptance criteria.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- There are no apparent bugs or issues in this script.
