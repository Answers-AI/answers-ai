Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a Sidekick object that represents a specific type of assistant within a broader software application. The Sidekick object contains various properties and methods related to root cause analysis. This script serves as a configuration file for the Sidekick component.

Script Structure:
The script starts with an import statement for the Sidekick type from the 'types' module. It then defines a constant variable named 'sidekick' which is an object of type Sidekick. The object has several properties and methods that define its behavior.

Import Statements:
- import { Sidekick } from 'types': This import statement brings in the Sidekick type from the 'types' module. The Sidekick type is likely defined in another file and exported for use in this script.

Classes and Functions:
- No classes or functions are defined in this script. Instead, the 'sidekick' object is defined as a constant variable and contains properties and methods.

Properties of the 'sidekick' object:
- departments: An array of strings representing different departments or areas of expertise related to root cause analysis.
- label: A string representing the label or name of the Sidekick object.
- value: A string representing the value or identifier of the Sidekick object.
- maxCompletionTokens: A number representing the maximum number of completion tokens allowed for the Sidekick object.
- placeholder: A string representing the placeholder text to be displayed when interacting with the Sidekick object.
- getSystemPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template for the Sidekick object. The function does not take any parameters and returns a string.
- getUserPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing a user prompt template for the Sidekick object. The function takes two parameters: 'query' (a string representing the user's query) and 'context' (an object representing the context of the user's query). The function returns a string.
- contextStringRender: A function that returns a string representing the rendering of the context object. The function takes one parameter: 'context' (an object representing the context of the user's query). The function returns a string.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
- There are no loops or conditional statements in this script.

Variable Usage:
- The 'sidekick' object is defined as a constant variable and its properties are assigned values that are not expected to change during runtime.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- There are no apparent bugs or issues in this script.

Summary:
This script defines and exports a Sidekick object that represents a specific type of assistant within a software application. The Sidekick object has properties and methods related to root cause analysis. The script serves as a configuration file for the Sidekick component and provides templates for system and user prompts. There are no classes or functions defined in this script. The 'sidekick' object is defined as a constant variable and its properties are assigned values that are not expected to change during runtime. No bugs or issues were identified in this script.
