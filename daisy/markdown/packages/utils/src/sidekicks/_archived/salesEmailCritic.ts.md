Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define a sales sidekick object that contains various properties and methods related to outbound email sales. This script is likely part of a broader software application that involves sales and marketing activities, specifically focused on improving outbound email communication.

Script Structure:
The script starts with an import statement for the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. It then defines a constant variable named "sales" which is of type "Sidekick". The "sales" object contains several properties such as "departments", "label", "value", "temperature", "frequency", "presence", "maxCompletionTokens", "placeholder", "getSystemPromptTemplate", "getUserPromptTemplate", and "contextStringRender". Finally, the "sales" object is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
- The import statement "{ Sidekick } from 'types'" imports the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. This type is likely defined elsewhere in the application and is used to ensure type safety and consistency when working with sales sidekick objects.

Classes and Functions:
- No classes or functions are defined in this script. Instead, the script defines an object literal named "sales" with various properties and methods.

Properties:
- "departments": An array of strings representing the departments associated with the sales sidekick.
- "label": A string representing the label or name of the sales sidekick.
- "value": A string representing the value or identifier of the sales sidekick.
- "temperature": A number representing the temperature of the sales sidekick.
- "frequency": A number representing the frequency of the sales sidekick.
- "presence": A number representing the presence of the sales sidekick.
- "maxCompletionTokens": A number representing the maximum completion tokens of the sales sidekick.
- "placeholder": A string representing the placeholder text of the sales sidekick.

Methods:
- "getSystemPromptTemplate": A function that returns a string representing the system prompt template for the sales sidekick. This template provides guidelines and instructions for creating outbound sales emails.
- "getUserPromptTemplate": A function that takes two parameters, "query" and "context", and returns a string representing the user prompt template for the sales sidekick. This template provides guidelines for critiquing outbound sales emails and asks the user to provide specific feedback and suggestions.
- "contextStringRender": A function that takes a "context" parameter and returns a string representing the rendered context for the sales sidekick. This function is likely used to display additional information about the sales sidekick's context, such as the file path and text.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
- There are no loops or conditional statements in this script.

Variable Usage:
- The script uses a constant variable named "sales" to store the sales sidekick object. This variable is not reassigned or modified after its initial declaration.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- There are no apparent bugs or issues in this script.

Summary:
This script defines a sales sidekick object with various properties and methods related to outbound email sales. It provides templates for system prompts, user prompts, and context rendering. The script does not contain any classes or functions, but rather defines an object literal with the necessary properties and methods. The script is likely part of a larger software application that involves sales and marketing activities. No bugs or issues were identified in the script.
