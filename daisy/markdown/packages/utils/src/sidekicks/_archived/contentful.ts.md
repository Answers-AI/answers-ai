Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a variable named "contentful" of type "Sidekick". This variable represents a Contentful expert and contains various properties and methods related to interacting with Contentful.

Script Structure:
The script starts with import statements, followed by the definition of the "contentful" variable using the "Sidekick" type. The variable is then assigned an object with properties and methods. Finally, the "contentful" variable is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
- The script imports the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. This type is used to define the type of the "contentful" variable.

Classes and Functions:
- The script does not contain any classes or functions. Instead, it defines an object literal assigned to the "contentful" variable. This object has the following properties and methods:
  - departments: An array of strings representing the departments the Contentful expert can assist with.
  - label: A string representing the label or title of the Contentful expert.
  - value: A string representing the value associated with the Contentful expert.
  - placeholder: A string representing a placeholder text for user input related to Contentful.
  - getSystemPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template for the Contentful expert.
  - getUserPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing a user prompt template for the Contentful expert. This function takes two parameters: "query" (a string representing the user's query) and "context" (a string representing the context in which the query is made).
  - contextStringRender: A function that returns a string representing the rendering of a context object. This function takes one parameter: "context" (an object with metadata properties).

Loops and Conditional Statements:
- The script does not contain any loops or conditional statements.

Variable Usage:
- The script uses the "contentful" variable to store an object representing a Contentful expert. The properties and methods of this object are used to define the behavior and responses of the Contentful expert.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- There are no apparent bugs or issues with the code in this script.
