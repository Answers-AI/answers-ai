Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a variable named "contentful" of type "Sidekick". This variable represents a Contentful expert and contains various properties and methods related to interacting with Contentful. The script's role within the broader software application is to provide a standardized way of accessing and utilizing Contentful expertise.

Script Structure:
The script starts with import statements, followed by the definition of the "contentful" variable using the "Sidekick" type. The variable is then assigned an object with properties and methods. Finally, the "contentful" variable is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
The script imports the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. The "Sidekick" type is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the application and is used to define the structure of the "contentful" variable.

Classes and Functions:
There are no classes defined in this script. Instead, the script defines an object literal assigned to the "contentful" variable. This object has the following properties and methods:

- departments: An array of strings representing the departments related to Contentful expertise.
- label: A string representing the label or title of the Contentful expert.
- value: A string representing the value associated with the Contentful expert.
- placeholder: A string representing a placeholder text for Contentful-related questions.
- getSystemPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template for the Contentful expert. This function does not take any parameters and always returns the same string.
- getUserPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing a user prompt template for the Contentful expert. This function takes two parameters: "query" (a string representing the user's question) and "context" (a string representing the context in which the question is asked). The function returns a string that includes the user's question, context, and additional instructions.
- contextStringRender: A function that returns a string representing the rendering of a given context. This function takes one parameter: "context" (an object containing metadata about the context). The function returns a string that includes the file path and text of the context.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
There are no loops or conditional statements in this script.

Variable Usage:
The script uses the "contentful" variable to store an object representing a Contentful expert. The properties of this object are used to define various aspects of the expert, such as departments, label, value, and placeholder. The methods of this object are used to generate prompt templates and render context strings.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
There are no apparent bugs or issues with this script. However, without further context about the broader application and its usage of the "contentful" variable, it is difficult to identify any potential bugs or issues. It is recommended to thoroughly test the integration of this script with the rest of the application and ensure that the defined properties and methods are used correctly.

Summary:
In summary, this script defines and exports a variable named "contentful" of type "Sidekick", representing a Contentful expert. The variable contains properties and methods related to Contentful expertise, such as departments, label, value, placeholder, prompt templates, and context rendering. The script does not contain any loops or conditional statements. It is important to integrate and utilize this script correctly within the broader application to leverage the defined Contentful expert functionality.
