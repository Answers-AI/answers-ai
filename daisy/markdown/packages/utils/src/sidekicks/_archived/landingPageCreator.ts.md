Script Structure:
The script starts with an import statement for the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. It then defines a constant variable named "marketing" using the "Sidekick" type. The variable is assigned an object with several properties and methods.

Import Statements:
- { Sidekick } from 'types': This import statement brings in the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. The "Sidekick" type is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the application.

Classes and Functions:
- getSystemPromptTemplate(): This function is a method of the "marketing" object. It returns a string that represents a system prompt template for the marketing sidekick. The template provides a brief description of the sidekick's role and expertise in assisting users with creating landing pages.

- getUserPromptTemplate(query, context): This function is a method of the "marketing" object. It takes two parameters: "query" and "context". It returns a string that represents a user prompt template for the marketing sidekick. The template provides instructions and guidelines for the user to create a landing page. It includes information about the desired sections, content, and design components. The "query" parameter represents the feature of the landing page, and the "context" parameter provides additional context about the feature and the overall product.

- contextStringRender(context): This function is a method of the "marketing" object. It takes a single parameter "context" and returns a string. The function is used to render the context information provided to the user in a specific format. It appends the "filePath" and "text" properties of the "context" object to a string and returns it.

The methods include "getSystemPromptTemplate", "getUserPromptTemplate", and "contextStringRender".
