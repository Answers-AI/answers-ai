Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that exports an object representing a debugging expert sidekick. The sidekick has properties and methods related to debugging code, including a label, value, placeholder text, and functions for generating prompt templates and rendering context strings. The module is intended to be used as part of a broader software application.

Import statements:
- `import { Sidekick } from 'types';`: This imports the `Sidekick` type from a module named 'types'. The `Sidekick` type is likely defined elsewhere in the application and is used to define the structure of the debugging sidekick object.

Script Summary:
The script exports a debugging sidekick object that has properties and methods related to code debugging. The object is defined as a constant named `debugging` and is of type `Sidekick`. It has the following properties:
- `departments`: An array of strings representing the departments the debugging expert is associated with.
