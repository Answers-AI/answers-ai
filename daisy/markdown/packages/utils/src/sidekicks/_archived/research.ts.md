Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a research assistant object, which contains various properties and methods related to a research assistant's functionality. This script plays a role within a broader software application by providing a pre-defined research assistant object that can be used in different parts of the application to assist with research-related tasks.

Script Structure:
The script starts with an import statement for the `Sidekick` type from the 'types' module. It then defines a constant variable named `research` which is of type `Sidekick`. The `research` object contains properties such as `departments`, `label`, `value`, `placeholder`, `getSystemPromptTemplate`, `getUserPromptTemplate`, and `contextStringRender`. Finally, the `research` object is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
- `import { Sidekick } from 'types';`: This import statement imports the `Sidekick` type from the 'types' module. The `Sidekick` type is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the application and is used to define the type of the `research` object.

Classes and Functions:
- No classes or functions are defined in this script. Instead, the `research` object is defined as a constant variable and contains various properties and methods.

Properties and Methods:
- `departments`: An array of strings representing different departments.
- `label`: A string representing the label of the research assistant.
- `value`: A string representing the value of the research assistant.
- `placeholder`: A string representing the placeholder text for the research assistant.
- `getSystemPromptTemplate`: A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template for the research assistant. The returned string provides instructions to the research assistant on how to help find answers to questions.
- `getUserPromptTemplate`: A function that takes two parameters (`query` and `context`) and returns a string representing a user prompt template for the research assistant. The returned string provides instructions to the user on how to ask a question and request a response from the research assistant.
- `contextStringRender`: A function that takes a `context` parameter and returns a string representing the rendered context. The returned string includes information about the context, such as the file path or URL, and the code or text associated with the context.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
- There are no loops or conditional statements in this script.

Variable Usage:
- The `research` object is defined as a constant variable and is not modified throughout the script.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- There are no apparent bugs or issues in this script.

Summary:
This script defines and exports a research assistant object that can be used in a software application. The research assistant object has properties related to departments, labels, values, and placeholder text. It also has methods for generating system and user prompt templates, as well as rendering context information. The script does not contain any classes or functions, and there are no loops or conditional statements. Overall, the script provides a pre-defined research assistant object that can be utilized in different parts of the application to assist with research tasks.
