Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a research assistant object, which contains various properties and methods related to a research assistant's functionality. This script plays a role within a broader software application by providing a pre-defined research assistant object that can be used in different parts of the application to assist with research-related tasks.

Script Structure:
The script starts with import statements, followed by the definition of the research assistant object using TypeScript syntax. Finally, the research assistant object is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
- The script imports the `Sidekick` type from the 'types' module. This type is used to define the structure of the research assistant object.

Classes and Functions:
- The script defines a constant variable `research` which is of type `Sidekick`. This variable represents the research assistant object.
- The `research` object has the following properties:
  - `departments`: An array of strings representing different departments that the research assistant can assist with.
  - `label`: A string representing the label or title of the research assistant.
  - `value`: A string representing the value or identifier of the research assistant.
  - `placeholder`: A string representing a placeholder message that can be displayed when using the research assistant.
  - `getSystemPromptTemplate`: A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template for the research assistant. This function does not take any parameters and returns a string.
  - `getUserPromptTemplate`: A function that takes two parameters, `query` and `context`, and returns a string representing a user prompt template for the research assistant. The `query` parameter represents the question to be asked, and the `context` parameter represents the context in which the question is asked. This function returns a string.
  - `contextStringRender`: A function that takes a `context` parameter and returns a string representing a rendered version of the context. The `context` parameter can have properties like `filePath`, `url`, `code`, or `text`. This function returns a string.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
There are no apparent bugs or issues with this script.

Summary:
This script defines and exports a research assistant object that can be used in a software application. The research assistant object has properties like departments, label, value, and placeholder, as well as methods like getSystemPromptTemplate, getUserPromptTemplate, and contextStringRender. These properties and methods can be used to interact with the research assistant and perform research-related tasks. The script does not contain any loops or conditional statements and does not have any apparent bugs or issues.
