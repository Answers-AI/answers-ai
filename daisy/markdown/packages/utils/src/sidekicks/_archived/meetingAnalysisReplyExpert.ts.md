Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a variable named "sales" that represents a sidekick object. This sidekick object contains various properties and methods related to generating a reply email for a customer based on a meeting transcript. The script's role within the broader software application is to provide a reusable component that can be used by an account manager to automate the process of crafting a reply email.

Script Structure:
The script starts with import statements, followed by the definition of the "sales" object using TypeScript syntax. The object has properties such as "departments", "temperature", "label", "value", "placeholder", "getSystemPromptTemplate", "getUserPromptTemplate", and "contextStringRender". Finally, the "sales" object is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
The script imports a single named export "Sidekick" from the module "types". The "Sidekick" type is likely a custom type defined elsewhere in the application and is used to define the type of the "sales" object.

1. getSystemPromptTemplate(): This function returns a string that represents a system prompt template. It provides information about the assistant's role, brand tone, and voice.

2. getUserPromptTemplate(query, context): This function takes two parameters, "query" and "context", and returns a string that represents a user prompt template. It provides instructions to the user on how to use the meeting transcript to craft a reply email.

3. contextStringRender(context): This function takes a "context" parameter and returns a string that represents the rendering of the context information. It includes details about the meeting, such as the title, URL, and transcript.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
