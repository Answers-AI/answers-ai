Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that exports an object named "sidekick". The purpose of this module is to define a sidekick object that can be used in a broader software application. The sidekick object contains properties and methods related to generating API documentation for a code repository that utilizes Next.js.

Import statements:
- The code imports the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. This type is used to define the type of the "sidekick" object.

Script Summary:
The script defines a constant variable named "sidekick" and assigns it an object value. The object has the following properties:
- "departments": An array of strings representing the departments that the sidekick is associated with. In this case, it is set to ['engineering'].
- "label": A string representing the label or name of the sidekick. It is set to 'API Docs Assistant'.
- "value": A string representing the value or identifier of the sidekick. It is set to 'engineeringDocsApi'.
- "temperature": A number representing the temperature or level of the sidekick. It is set to 1.
- "placeholder": A string representing the placeholder text for the sidekick. It is set to 'I can help you craft API docs. Works well with codebases'.
- "getSystemPromptTemplate": A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template. It takes no parameters and returns a string.
- "getUserPromptTemplate": A function that returns a string representing a user prompt template. It takes two parameters: "query" (a string) and "context" (an object). It returns a string.
- "contextStringRender": A function that returns a string representing the rendering of a context object. It takes one parameter: "context" (an object). It returns a string.

External Functions:
- "getSystemPromptTemplate": This function returns a string that represents a system prompt template. The returned string is hardcoded and does not depend on any input parameters.
- "getUserPromptTemplate": This function returns a string that represents a user prompt template. The returned string includes the values of the "query" and "context" parameters, which are interpolated into the template.
- "contextStringRender": This function returns a string that represents the rendering of a context object. The returned string includes the values of the "filePath" and "text" properties of the "context" object, which are interpolated into the template.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be imported and used in other parts of the software application to access the "sidekick" object and its properties and methods. The "sidekick" object can be used to generate API documentation for a code repository that utilizes Next.js.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the "sidekick" object to add or remove departments?
- How can I change the label or value of the sidekick?
- How can I modify the templates returned by the "getSystemPromptTemplate" and "getUserPromptTemplate" functions?
- How can I customize the rendering of the context object in the "contextStringRender" function?
