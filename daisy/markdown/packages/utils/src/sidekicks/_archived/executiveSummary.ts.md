Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export a variable named "sales" that represents an object with various properties and methods related to writing executive summaries of datasets. This script likely serves as a configuration file or data source for other parts of the software application that require access to the "sales" object.

Script Structure:
The script begins with an import statement that imports the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. It then defines a constant variable named "sales" that represents an object with various properties and methods. Finally, it exports the "sales" variable as the default export of the module.

Import Statements:
- The import statement "{ Sidekick } from 'types'" imports the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. This type is likely defined elsewhere in the application and is used to provide type annotations for the "sales" object.

Classes and Functions:
- The "sales" object does not contain any classes or functions. Instead, it defines various properties and methods as follows:
  - "departments": An array of strings representing different departments.
  - "label": A string representing the label of the executive summary.
  - "value": A string representing the value of the executive summary.
  - "temperature": A number representing the temperature of the executive summary.
  - "frequency": A number representing the frequency of the executive summary.
  - "presence": A number representing the presence of the executive summary.
  - "maxCompletionTokens": A number representing the maximum number of completion tokens for the executive summary.
  - "placeholder": A string representing a placeholder text for the executive summary.
  - "getSystemPromptTemplate": A function that returns a string representing a system prompt template for the executive summary.
  - "getUserPromptTemplate": A function that takes two parameters (query and context) and returns a string representing a user prompt template for the executive summary.
  - "contextStringRender": A function that takes a context parameter and returns a string representing a rendered context for the executive summary.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
- There are no loops or conditional statements in this script.

Variable Usage:
- The "sales" object is a constant variable that represents the configuration for the executive summary. Its properties are used to define various aspects of the executive summary, such as departments, label, value, temperature, frequency, presence, maxCompletionTokens, placeholder, and prompt templates.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- There are no apparent bugs or issues in this script.

Summary:
This script defines and exports a variable named "sales" that represents an object with properties and methods related to writing executive summaries of datasets. The "sales" object contains various configuration options and prompt templates for generating executive summaries. It does not contain any classes or functions, but rather defines properties and methods directly on the object. The script does not include any loops or conditional statements. Overall, the script serves as a configuration file or data source for other parts of the software application that require access to the "sales" object.
