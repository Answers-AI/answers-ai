Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define a Sidekick object for a code refactoring assistant within a broader software application. The Sidekick object contains properties and methods related to the code refactoring functionality. This script serves as a configuration file for the refactoring assistant, providing information about the assistant's capabilities and behavior.

Script Structure:
The script starts with an import statement for the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. It then defines a constant variable named "refactor" which is of type "Sidekick". The "refactor" object contains properties and methods related to the code refactoring assistant. Finally, the "refactor" object is exported as the default export of the script.

Import Statements:
- The script imports the "Sidekick" type from the "types" module. This import statement allows the script to use the "Sidekick" type for defining the "refactor" object.

Classes and Functions:
- The script does not define any classes or functions. Instead, it defines an object literal named "refactor" which contains properties and methods.

Properties of the "refactor" Object:
- departments: An array of strings representing the departments or areas of expertise of the code refactoring assistant. In this case, it only includes "engineering".
- label: A string representing the label or title of the code refactoring assistant. In this case, it is set to "Refactoring Expert".
- value: A string representing the value or identifier of the code refactoring assistant. In this case, it is set to "refactor".
- placeholder: A string representing the placeholder text for the code refactoring assistant. In this case, it is set to "I can create refactor code for you".
- getSystemPromptTemplate: A function that returns a string representing the system prompt template for the code refactoring assistant. It does not take any parameters and always returns the same string: "You are a code refactoring assistant.".
- getUserPromptTemplate: A function that takes two parameters: "query" (a string) and "context" (an object). It returns a string representing the user prompt template for the code refactoring assistant. The returned string includes placeholders for the "query" and "context" values.
- contextStringRender: A function that takes one parameter: "context" (an object). It returns a string representing the rendered context string for the code refactoring assistant. The returned string includes the "filePath" or "url" property and the "code" or "text" property of the "context" object.

Summary of Findings:
- The script defines a Sidekick object for a code refactoring assistant within a software application.
- The Sidekick object has properties and methods related to the code refactoring functionality.
- The script does not define any classes or functions, but instead defines an object literal named "refactor".
- The "refactor" object has properties for departments, label, value, placeholder, and methods for getting system and user prompt templates, and rendering context strings.
