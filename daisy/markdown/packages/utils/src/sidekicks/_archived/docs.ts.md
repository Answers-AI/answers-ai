Interaction Summary:
This script represents a code documentation assistant that can be used within a broader software application. It provides a user prompt template for documenting code and a function to render the context of the code being documented. The `docs` object can be used by other components or modules in the application to facilitate code documentation.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use the `docs` object in my code to generate code documentation?
- What are the available properties and methods of the `docs` object?
- How can I customize the user prompt template generated by the `getUserPromptTemplate` function?
- How can I customize the rendering of the code context in the `contextStringRender` function?
