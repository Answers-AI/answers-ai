Summary:
This code defines a class called `OpenAI` that interacts with the OpenAI API to perform tasks such as creating embeddings and chat completions. It uses the `openai` library and relies on a Redis cache for caching embeddings. The class has methods for creating embeddings and chat completions, and it also has a default model that can be overridden.

Import statements:
- `openai`: This is the main library used to interact with the OpenAI API.
- `redisLoader`: This is a custom module that provides a Redis-based caching mechanism for loading embeddings.
- `DataLoader`: This is a utility class from the `dataloader` library that helps with batching and caching data loading operations.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called `OpenAI` that encapsulates the functionality for interacting with the OpenAI API. It has methods for creating embeddings and chat completions. The class also uses a Redis cache to store and retrieve embeddings.

Internal Functions:
- `constructor()`: This is the constructor method of the `OpenAI` class. It initializes the `openai` object with the provided API key and sets up the `embeddingsLoader` object with the Redis cache configuration.
- `createEmbedding()`: This method takes an input string and an optional model name and returns the embedding for the input. It uses the `embeddingsLoader` object to load the embedding from the cache if available, or fetch it from the OpenAI API and store it in the cache if not.
- `createChatCompletion()`: This method takes a chat completion request object and returns the completion response. It uses the `openai` object to make the API call and handles any errors that occur.

External Functions:
- `sleep(ms: number)`: This is a utility function that takes a number of milliseconds and returns a promise that resolves after the specified time. It is used for adding delays in the code.

Interaction Summary:
The `OpenAI` class can be used by other parts of the application to create embeddings and perform chat completions using the OpenAI API. Developers can create an instance of the `OpenAI` class and call its methods to perform these tasks.

Developer Questions:
- How do I create an instance of the `OpenAI` class?
- How do I set a different default model for the `OpenAI` class?
- How do I create an embedding for a given input?
- How do I perform a chat completion using the `OpenAI` class?
- How do I handle errors that occur during API calls?
