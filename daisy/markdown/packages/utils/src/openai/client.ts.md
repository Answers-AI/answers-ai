Summary:
This code is responsible for initializing and exporting an instance of the OpenAI API. It sets up the necessary configuration and authentication using an API key provided as an environment variable.

Import statements:
- `Configuration` and `OpenAIApi` are imported from the 'openai' module. These classes are used to configure and interact with the OpenAI API.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single instance of the OpenAIApi class, which is initialized with the necessary configuration. The configuration includes the API key retrieved from the environment variable.

Internal Functions:
- `initializeOpenAI`: This function initializes and returns an instance of the OpenAIApi class. It creates a new Configuration object with the API key provided as an environment variable, and then uses that configuration to create a new OpenAIApi instance.

External Functions:
None.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be imported and used by other parts of the application to interact with the OpenAI API. The exported `openai` object provides a convenient interface for making API calls.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `openai` object to make API calls?
- How do I handle errors or exceptions when using the OpenAI API?
- How do I configure the OpenAI API to use a different API key or endpoint?
- How do I handle rate limiting or other API restrictions?
