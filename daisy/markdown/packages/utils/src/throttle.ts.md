Summary:
This code defines a function called "throttle" that takes in another function and a delay as parameters. The purpose of this function is to throttle the execution of the input function, meaning it limits the rate at which the function can be called. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to prevent a function from being called too frequently, such as in event handlers.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
The script defines a type called "ThrottledFunction" which represents a function that can be throttled. It then exports a function called "throttle" that takes in a function and a delay, and returns a throttled version of the input function.

Internal Functions:
- throttle: This is the main function of the script. It takes in a function (func) and a delay (number) as parameters. It returns a throttled version of the input function. Inside the function, it initializes a variable called "isThrottled" to false, which keeps track of whether the function is currently being throttled. It also initializes a variable called "lastArgs" to null, which stores the arguments of the last call to the function.

  - throttledFunction: This is an inner function that represents the throttled version of the input function. It takes in any number of arguments (args) and executes the following steps:
    - If the function is currently being throttled (isThrottled is true), it stores the arguments in the "lastArgs" variable and returns.
    - If the function is not being throttled, it calls the input function (func) with the provided arguments.
    - It then sets "isThrottled" to true to indicate that the function is now being throttled.
    - After the specified delay (in milliseconds), it sets "isThrottled" back to false.
    - If there are any stored arguments in "lastArgs" (indicating that the function was called while being throttled), it calls the throttledFunction recursively with the stored arguments and sets "lastArgs" to null.

External Functions:
- throttle: This is the exported function that can be used by other parts of the application. It takes in a function and a delay as parameters and returns a throttled version of the input function.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used by importing the "throttle" function and calling it with a function and a delay. The returned throttled function can then be used in event handlers or any other scenario where throttling is desired.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the "throttle" function in my code?
- What happens if I call the throttled function multiple times within the specified delay?
- Can I customize the delay for each call to the throttled function?
- How can I test the behavior of the throttled function?
