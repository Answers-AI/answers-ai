Summary:
This code defines a function called "throttle" that takes in another function and a delay as parameters. The purpose of this function is to throttle the execution of the input function, meaning it limits the rate at which the function can be called. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to prevent a function from being called too frequently, such as in event handlers.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
The script defines a type called "ThrottledFunction" which represents a function that can be throttled. It then exports a function called "throttle" that takes in a function and a delay, and returns a throttled version of the input function.

Internal Functions:
- throttle: This is the main function of the script. It takes in a function (func) and a delay (number) as parameters. It creates two variables, "isThrottled" and "lastArgs", to keep track of the throttling state. It then defines a nested function called "throttledFunction" which will be returned as the throttled version of the input function. Inside this nested function, it checks if the function is currently throttled. If it is, it stores the arguments in the "lastArgs" variable and returns. If it is not throttled, it calls the input function with the arguments, sets the "isThrottled" variable to true, and schedules a timeout using setTimeout. After the delay, the timeout callback sets "isThrottled" to false and checks if there are any stored arguments in "lastArgs". If there are, it calls the throttled function recursively with the stored arguments and resets "lastArgs" to null. Finally, the throttled function is returned.

External Functions:
- throttle: This is the only function exported by the script. It takes in a function and a delay as parameters and returns a throttled version of the input function.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used by importing the "throttle" function and calling it with the desired function to be throttled and the desired delay. The returned throttled function can then be used in place of the original function to limit its execution rate.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the "throttle" function in my code?
- What happens if I call the throttled function multiple times within the delay period?
- Can I customize the behavior of the throttled function, such as the delay or the throttling logic?
- Are there any performance considerations when using the throttled function?
