Summary:
This code is a script that utilizes the OpenAI API to summarize text. It splits the input text into smaller chunks, generates summaries for each chunk using the OpenAI model, and then combines the summaries into a final summary. The script provides a function called `summarizeAI` that takes in the input text, prompt, chunk size, maximum tokens, and an optional ID, and returns the final summary.

Import statements:
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from 'langchain/text_splitter': This import is used to split the input text into smaller chunks.
- `randomUUID` from 'crypto': This import is used to generate a random ID if one is not provided.
- `openai` from './openai/client': This import is used to interact with the OpenAI API.
- `Document` from 'langchain/document': This import is used to represent a document.

Script Summary:
The script defines a few constants for the OpenAI models to be used. It also defines two utility functions, `sleep` and `timeout`, which are used for delaying execution and setting a timeout respectively. The main function, `summarizeAI`, takes in the input text, prompt, chunk size, maximum tokens, and an optional ID. It splits the input text into smaller chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, generates summaries for each chunk using the OpenAI model, and then combines the summaries into a final summary. The function handles cases where the input text is already a single chunk or multiple chunks. The final summary is returned as a string.

Internal Functions:
- `sleep(ms: number): Promise<void>`: This function takes in a number of milliseconds and returns a promise that resolves after the specified delay.
- `timeout(ms: number): Promise<never>`: This function takes in a number of milliseconds and returns a promise that rejects with an error after the specified timeout.

External Functions:
- `summarizeAI({ input, prompt, chunkSize = 4000, maxTokens = 1000, id }: { input: string; prompt?: string; chunkSize?: number; max_recurse?: number; maxTokens?: number; id?: string; }): Promise<string>`: This function takes in the input text, prompt, chunk size, maximum tokens, and an optional ID. It splits the input text into smaller chunks, generates summaries for each chunk using the OpenAI model, and then combines the summaries into a final summary. The function returns a promise that resolves with the final summary as a string.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the OpenAI API to generate text summaries. It uses the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the input text into smaller chunks and the `openai` client to interact with the OpenAI API. The generated summaries can be used in various applications that require summarization of text.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the chunk size or maximum tokens for the summaries?
- Can I use a different OpenAI model for summarization?
- How can I handle errors or timeouts when generating the summaries?
- How can I integrate this script into my existing application?
