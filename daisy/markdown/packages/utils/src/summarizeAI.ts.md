Summary:
This code is a script that utilizes the OpenAI API to summarize text. It splits the input text into smaller chunks, generates summaries for each chunk using the OpenAI model, and then combines the summaries into a final summary. The script provides a function called `summarizeAI` that takes in the input text, prompt, chunk size, maximum tokens, and an optional ID, and returns the final summary.

Import statements:
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from 'langchain/text_splitter': This import is used to split the input text into smaller chunks.
- `randomUUID` from 'crypto': This import is used to generate a random ID if one is not provided.
- `openai` from './openai/client': This import is used to interact with the OpenAI API.
- `Document` from 'langchain/document': This import is used to represent a document.

Script Summary:
The script defines a few constants for the OpenAI models to be used. It also defines two utility functions, `sleep` and `timeout`, which are used for delaying execution and setting a timeout respectively. The main function, `summarizeAI`, is an asynchronous function that takes in the input text, prompt, chunk size, maximum tokens, and an optional ID. It splits the input text into smaller chunks, generates summaries for each chunk, and combines the summaries into a final summary. The function returns the final summary.

Internal Functions:
- `sleep(ms: number)`: This function takes in a number of milliseconds and returns a promise that resolves after the specified delay.
- `timeout(ms: number)`: This function takes in a number of milliseconds and returns a promise that rejects with an error after the specified timeout.

External Functions:
- `summarizeAI({ input, prompt, chunkSize = 4000, maxTokens = 1000, id }: { input: string; prompt?: string; chunkSize?: number; max_recurse?: number; maxTokens?: number; id?: string; }): Promise<string>`: This function takes in the input text, prompt, chunk size, maximum tokens, and an optional ID. It splits the input text into smaller chunks, generates summaries for each chunk, and combines the summaries into a final summary. The function returns a promise that resolves with the final summary.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a standalone module or integrated into a larger software application. Developers can call the `summarizeAI` function with the appropriate parameters to generate summaries for text inputs. The script relies on the OpenAI API and requires valid API credentials to function properly.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use this script to generate summaries for text inputs?
- What are the default values for the optional parameters of the `summarizeAI` function?
- How can I modify the OpenAI models used by this script?
- What happens if the input text is empty or null?
- How can I handle errors that occur during the text splitting process?
- How can I handle timeouts when generating summaries for large inputs?
