Summary:
This code snippet is a TypeScript module that exports two functions: `getUrlDomain` and `getUniqueDomains`. The purpose of this module is to extract the domain name from a given URL and to return a list of unique domain names from a list of URLs.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code snippet.

Script Summary:
The script exports two functions: `getUrlDomain` and `getUniqueDomains`. The `getUrlDomain` function takes a URL as input and returns the domain name of that URL. The `getUniqueDomains` function takes an array of URLs as input and returns an array of unique domain names extracted from those URLs.

Internal Functions:
- `getUrlDomain(url: string)`: This function takes a URL as input and returns the domain name of that URL. It first checks if the URL starts with either "http://" or "https://". If not, it prepends "http://" to the URL. Then, it creates a new `URL` object with the formatted URL and extracts the hostname from it. The "www." prefix is removed from the hostname if present, and the function returns the domain name with "https://" prepended. If any error occurs during the process, the function silently catches it and does nothing.

External Functions:
- `getUniqueDomains(urls: string[])`: This function takes an array of URLs as input and returns an array of unique domain names extracted from those URLs. It uses the `Array.from` method to convert a `Set` of domain names into an array. The `Set` is created by mapping each URL in the input array to its domain name using the `getUrlDomain` function.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be imported and used by other parts of the application that need to extract domain names from URLs or obtain a list of unique domain names from a list of URLs.

Developer Questions:
1. What happens if an invalid URL is passed to the `getUrlDomain` function?
   - The function will silently catch any error that occurs during the process and return nothing. It would be helpful to add error handling and provide feedback or throw an error in such cases.
2. Can the `getUniqueDomains` function handle a large number of URLs efficiently?
   - The function uses a `Set` to store unique domain names, which ensures that duplicates are automatically removed. However, the performance of the function may degrade if the input array contains a very large number of URLs. It would be worth considering optimizations, such as using a more efficient data structure or implementing a more optimized algorithm, if performance becomes an issue.
