Summary:
This code is a script that handles the indexing of text content from a markdown file. It is part of a broader software application that likely involves managing and organizing documents. The script takes in a set of parameters including the content of the markdown file, the title, source, and organization ID. It then processes the content, creates a document in the database, and generates embedded vectors for the text.

Import statements:
- `EventVersionHandler` from './EventVersionHandler': This imports a class or function named `EventVersionHandler` from a file called 'EventVersionHandler' in the same directory as the current script.
- `prisma` from '@db/client': This imports an object named `prisma` from a file or module called 'client' in a directory called 'db' that is located in the root directory of the application.
- `uuidV4` from 'uuid': This imports a function named `uuidV4` from a module called 'uuid'.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from 'langchain/text_splitter': This imports a class or function named `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from a module called 'text_splitter' in a directory called 'langchain'.

Script Summary:
The script defines a function named `slugify` that takes in a string and returns a slugified version of the string. It then exports an object named `indexText` which is an instance of `EventVersionHandler`. This object has properties for the event type, version, and a handler function. The handler function is an asynchronous function that takes in an event object and performs various operations including fetching user data, creating a document in the database, and generating embedded vectors for the text content.

Internal Functions:
- `slugify(text?: string)`: This function takes in an optional string parameter `text` and returns a slugified version of the string. It converts the string to lowercase, replaces spaces with hyphens, and removes any non-alphanumeric characters.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
The `indexText` script interacts with the `prisma` object to fetch user data and create a document in the database. It also interacts with the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class to split the content into chunks for processing. Additionally, it calls the `embedVectors` function to generate embedded vectors for the text content.

Developer Questions:
- How does the `EventVersionHandler` class work and what other methods or properties does it have?
- What is the purpose of the `prisma` object and how is it configured?
- How does the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class split the text content into chunks?
- What does the `embedVectors` function do and what parameters does it expect?
