Summary:
This code is a module that handles two events related to prompts in a chat application. The first event, "answers/prompt.upserted", is triggered when a prompt is created or updated. The second event, "answers/prompt.answered", is triggered when a user answers a prompt. The module contains two event handlers that handle these events by interacting with a Prisma database.

Import statements:
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module, which is likely a custom module that provides a Prisma client for database operations.
- `Chat` is imported from the `db/generated/prisma-client` module, which is likely a generated Prisma client module that provides types and functions for interacting with the `Chat` model in the database.
- `Message` is imported from the `types` module, which is likely a custom module that provides types for messages in the chat application.
- `EventVersionHandler` is imported from the `./EventVersionHandler` module, which is likely a custom module that provides a type definition for event handlers.

Script Summary:
The script defines two event handlers, `answersPromptUpserted` and `answersPromptAnswered`, which handle the "answers/prompt.upserted" and "answers/prompt.answered" events, respectively. These event handlers interact with the Prisma database to create or update prompts and connect answers to prompts.

Internal Functions:
- `answersPromptUpserted.handler`: This function is an async function that handles the "answers/prompt.upserted" event. It takes an event object as a parameter and extracts the necessary data from it. It then performs database operations using the Prisma client to create or update prompts based on the event data.
- `answersPromptAnswered.handler`: This function is an async function that handles the "answers/prompt.answered" event. It takes an event object as a parameter and extracts the necessary data from it. It then performs database operations using the Prisma client to connect an answer message to a prompt based on the event data.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This module interacts with a Prisma database using the Prisma client to create or update prompts and connect answer messages to prompts. It is likely used as a part of a larger chat application to handle prompt-related events.

Developer Questions:
- How are the event objects structured and what data do they contain?
- What other event handlers are there in the application and how do they interact with this module?
- Are there any additional database operations that need to be performed when handling these events?
- How can the error handling be improved in the event handlers?
- Are there any performance optimizations that can be made when interacting with the database?
