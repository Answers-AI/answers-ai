Summary:
This code is a module that handles two events related to prompts in a chat application. The first event, "answers/prompt.upserted", is triggered when a prompt is created or updated. The second event, "answers/prompt.answered", is triggered when a user answers a prompt. The module uses the Prisma ORM to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on prompts and messages.

Import statements:
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module, which is responsible for connecting to the database and providing access to the Prisma client.
- `Chat` is imported from the `db/generated/prisma-client` module, which contains the generated Prisma client code for the Chat model.
- `Message` is imported from the `types` module, which likely contains type definitions for various data structures used in the application.
- `EventVersionHandler` is imported from the `./EventVersionHandler` module, which is a custom event handler class.

Script Summary:
The script defines two event handlers, `answersPromptUpserted` and `answersPromptAnswered`, which handle the "answers/prompt.upserted" and "answers/prompt.answered" events, respectively. Each event handler is an object with a `v` property representing the version of the event, an `event` property representing the event name, and a `handler` property containing an async function that handles the event.

Internal Functions:
- `answersPromptUpserted.handler`: This function handles the "answers/prompt.upserted" event. It extracts the necessary data from the event object, such as the prompt content, user ID, and chat ID. It then performs database operations using the Prisma client to create or update a prompt record based on the provided data.
- `answersPromptAnswered.handler`: This function handles the "answers/prompt.answered" event. It extracts the prompt content and message data from the event object and uses the Prisma client to update the prompt record by connecting it to the answered message.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This module interacts with the Prisma client to perform database operations related to prompts and messages. It likely receives events from other parts of the application and updates the database accordingly. Other parts of the application may trigger the "answers/prompt.upserted" and "answers/prompt.answered" events to create or update prompts and connect them to answered messages.

Developer Questions:
- How are events triggered and passed to these event handlers?
- What other modules or components interact with this module?
- Are there any additional event handlers for different events?
- How are errors handled in these event handlers?
- Are there any performance considerations when performing database operations?
