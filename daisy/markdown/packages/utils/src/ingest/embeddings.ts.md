Summary:
This code is a script that handles the processing and upserting of vectors using the PineconeClient library. It receives an event containing vectors and organization information, creates embeddings for the vectors using OpenAI, and writes the vectors to a Pinecone index. It also updates the status of associated documents in the database.

Import statements:
- `PineconeClient`: This is imported from the '../pinecone/client' file and is used to interact with the Pinecone service.
- `EventVersionHandler`: This is imported from the './EventVersionHandler' file and is a type definition for event handlers.
- `PineconeVector`: This is imported from the 'types' file and is a type definition for vectors used in the Pinecone service.
- `prisma`: This is imported from the '@db/client' file and is used to interact with the database.
- `OpenAI`: This is imported from the '../openai/openai' file and is used to create embeddings using OpenAI.

Script Summary:
- The script creates instances of the PineconeClient and OpenAI classes.
- It defines a constant `DISABLE_EMBEDDING` which determines whether to disable embedding creation.
- It exports a function `processVectorsUpserted` which is the event handler for the 'pinecone/vectors.upserted' event.
- The function receives an event object containing vectors and organization information.
- It creates embeddings for the vectors using OpenAI and formats the data for writing to the Pinecone index.
- If embedding creation is not disabled, it writes the vectors to the Pinecone index.
- It retrieves the URLs or document IDs associated with the vectors.
- It performs database operations to update the status of associated documents.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `processVectorsUpserted`: This function is the event handler for the 'pinecone/vectors.upserted' event. It receives an event object containing vectors and organization information. It creates embeddings for the vectors using OpenAI, writes the vectors to the Pinecone index, and updates the status of associated documents in the database.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Pinecone service, the OpenAI service, and the database. It uses the PineconeClient library to write vectors to the Pinecone index and the OpenAI library to create embeddings. It also uses the Prisma library to interact with the database and update document statuses.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the `DISABLE_EMBEDDING` constant and how can it be modified?
- How are the vectors and organization information extracted from the event object?
- What is the structure of the `vectorData` array and how is it used?
- How are the document URLs or IDs retrieved from the vectors?
- How are the document statuses updated in the database?
