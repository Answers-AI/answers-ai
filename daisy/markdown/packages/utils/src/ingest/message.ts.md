Summary:
This code is a script that handles the event of a message being sent in a chat. It is part of a broader software application that involves chat functionality. The script receives information about the message, such as the chat ID, message ID, filters, user information, role, and content. It then performs various operations, including retrieving previous messages, creating a new message, and updating the chat title using an AI model.

Import statements:
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is used to interact with the database.
- `AnswersFilters` and `User` are imported from the `types` module. They are used to define the types of the filters and user information.
- `EventVersionHandler` is imported from the `EventVersionHandler` module. It is a type definition for event handlers.
- `openai` is imported from the `../openai/client` module. It is used to interact with the OpenAI API.

Script Summary:
The script defines a constant named `answersMessageSent`, which is an event handler for the event `answers/message.sent`. The handler function is asynchronous and takes an event object as a parameter. It extracts relevant data from the event, such as the role, content, chat ID, and message ID. It then retrieves previous messages from the database, creates a new message if necessary, updates the chat title using an AI model, and returns the created message.

Internal Functions:
- `AIUpdateChatTitle`: This function takes a `history` string and a `chatId` string as parameters. It creates a prompt for the OpenAI API using the conversation history and sends a completion request. It extracts the generated title from the response and updates the chat title in the database.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the database using the Prisma client to retrieve and create messages. It also interacts with the OpenAI API to generate a title for the chat based on the conversation history. The created message and updated chat title are then stored in the database.

Developer Questions:
- How does the event object look like and what data does it contain?
- What is the purpose of the `AnswersFilters` and `User` types?
- How does the `AIUpdateChatTitle` function generate a title using the OpenAI API?
- What is the significance of the `v` and `event` properties in the `answersMessageSent` constant?
- How can I modify the script to handle additional event types or perform additional operations when a message is sent?
