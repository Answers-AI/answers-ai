Summary:
This code is a script that processes documents, either in PDF or DOCX format, and converts them into HTML. The script retrieves the document from an AWS S3 bucket, converts it to the appropriate format, and then converts it to HTML using different libraries. The resulting HTML is then stored in a database and embedded into a vector index for further processing.

Script Summary:
The script processes documents in PDF or DOCX format and converts them to HTML. It retrieves the document from an AWS S3 bucket, converts it to the appropriate format, and then converts it to HTML using different libraries. The resulting HTML is stored in a database and embedded into a vector index for further processing.

Internal Functions:
- `slugify`: This function converts a string to a URL-friendly slug.
- `calculateLineHeightRange`: This function calculates the range of line heights in a list of lines.
- `getHeaderTag`: This function determines the appropriate HTML header tag based on the line height and the range of line heights.
- `convertToValidHTML`: This function converts a list of lines to a valid HTML string.
- `convertPdfToHtml`: This function converts a PDF buffer to an HTML string using the pdfjs-dist library.
- `splitDocumentHtmlChunkMore`: This function splits a markdown chunk into smaller chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter library.
- `splitDocumentHtml`: This function splits a document's HTML content into smaller chunks based on headings.
- `prefixHeaders`: This function prefixes headers in a markdown document with parent headers.
- `getDocumentRecordsVectors`: This function converts a list of DocumentRecords to vectors for embedding in a vector index.

External Functions:
- `processDocument`: This is an event handler function that processes a document. It retrieves the document from an AWS S3 bucket, converts it to the appropriate format, converts it to HTML, stores it in a database, and embeds it in a vector index.

Interaction Summary:
The script interacts with an AWS S3 bucket to retrieve documents, uses different libraries to convert the documents to HTML, stores the HTML in a database, and embeds the HTML in a vector index for further processing.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the script to support other document formats?
- How can I handle errors during the document processing?
- How can I improve the performance of the script for large documents?
- How can I customize the HTML output for different document types?
- How can I integrate the script with other parts of the application?
