Summary:
This code is a module that exports a function called `createInngestFunctions`. The purpose of this function is to create a set of event handler functions that can be used by the `inngest` module. These event handler functions are responsible for processing specific events and executing the appropriate logic based on the event type and version.

Import statements:
- `inngest` is imported from the `client` module.
- `User` and `AppSettings` are imported from the `types` module.
- `createStepTools` is imported from the `inngest/components/InngestStepTools` module.
- `Organization` is imported from the `db/generated/prisma-client` module.

Script Summary:
The `createInngestFunctions` function takes an array of `eventHandlers` as a parameter. It filters and reduces the `eventHandlers` array to create a `eventHandlerMap` object, which groups the event handlers by event name and version. Then, it creates a set of event handler functions using the `inngest.createFunction` method and returns them as an array.

Internal Functions:
- `createInngestFunctions`: This function takes an array of `eventHandlers` as a parameter and returns an array of event handler functions. It filters and reduces the `eventHandlers` array to create a `eventHandlerMap` object, which groups the event handlers by event name and version. Then, it creates a set of event handler functions using the `inngest.createFunction` method and returns them as an array.

External Functions:
- `EventHandler`: This type represents a function that handles an event. It takes an object with properties `event` and `step` as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to an unknown value.
- `EventVersionHandler`: This type represents an object that defines an event handler. It has properties `event`, `v`, and `handler`, where `event` is the event name, `v` is the version of the event, and `handler` is the event handler function.

Interaction Summary:
This module interacts with the `inngest` module by using its `createFunction` method to create event handler functions. It also imports types from the `types` module and the `db/generated/prisma-client` module.

Developer Questions:
- How do I add a new event handler to the `eventHandlers` array?
- How do I modify the logic inside an event handler function?
- How do I handle errors that occur during event processing?
- How do I access the `event` and `step` objects inside an event handler function?
- How do I specify the version of an event when creating an event handler?
