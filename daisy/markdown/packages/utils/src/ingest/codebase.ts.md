Summary:
This code is a script that handles the embedding of codebase text into vectors. It is part of a broader software application that deals with codebase synchronization. The script takes in data related to a codebase repository, including the text content, repository URL, file path, and organization ID. It then uses various functions and libraries to process the text, split it into chunks, and embed it into vectors. The resulting embedded vectors are returned as the output.

Import statements:
- `EventVersionHandler` from './EventVersionHandler': This imports the `EventVersionHandler` class from a local file named 'EventVersionHandler'.
- `prisma` from '@db/client': This imports the `prisma` object from a database client module named 'client' in the '@db' package.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from 'langchain/text_splitter': This imports the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class from a library named 'langchain/text_splitter'.
- `embedVectors` from '../pinecone/embedVectors': This imports the `embedVectors` function from a local file named 'embedVectors' in the '../pinecone' directory.

Script Summary:
The script defines a constant named `codebaseEmbeddings` which is an object with properties `event`, `v`, and `handler`. The `event` property is set to 'codebase/repo.sync' and the `v` property is set to '1'. The `handler` property is an asynchronous function that takes in an object parameter `event`. Inside the function, the codebase data is extracted from the `event` object and stored in variables. The script then performs various operations using the imported libraries and functions, including upserting a document in the database, retrieving the organization ID, splitting the text into chunks, and embedding the chunks into vectors. The resulting embedded vectors are returned as the output of the function.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `codebaseEmbeddings.handler`: This is the main function of the script. It takes in an object parameter `event` and performs various operations to handle the embedding of codebase text into vectors. It returns the embedded vectors as the output.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with a database client (`prisma`) to upsert a document representing the codebase in the database. It also interacts with a text splitter library (`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`) to split the codebase text into chunks. Additionally, it uses a function (`embedVectors`) to embed the text chunks into vectors. The script may also interact with other parts of the application to retrieve user and organization information.

Developer Questions:
- How does the `prisma` database client work and what operations does it support?
- What is the purpose of the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` library and how does it split the text into chunks?
- How does the `embedVectors` function embed the text chunks into vectors?
- How is the organization ID retrieved and what happens if it is not found?
- What is the structure of the `event` object and what properties does it contain?
- What is the purpose of the `metadata` object and how is it used in the database upsert operation?
- What is the significance of the `uid` property in the `embedVectors` function?
