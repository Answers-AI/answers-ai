Summary:
This code is a script that handles the embedding of codebase text into vectors. It is part of a broader software application that deals with codebase synchronization. The script takes in data related to a codebase repository, including the text content, repository URL, file path, and organization ID. It then uses various functions and libraries to process the text, create documents, and embed the vectors. The resulting embedded vectors are returned as the output.

Import statements:
- `EventVersionHandler` from './EventVersionHandler': This imports the `EventVersionHandler` class from a local file named 'EventVersionHandler'.
- `prisma` from '@db/client': This imports the `prisma` object from a database client module named 'client' in the '@db' package.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from 'langchain/text_splitter': This imports the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class from a library named 'langchain/text_splitter'.
- `embedVectors` from '../pinecone/embedVectors': This imports the `embedVectors` function from a local file named 'embedVectors' in the '../pinecone' directory.

Script Summary:
The script defines a constant named `codebaseEmbeddings` which is an object with properties `event`, `v`, and `handler`. The `event` property is set to 'codebase/repo.sync' and the `v` property is set to '1'. The `handler` property is an asynchronous function that takes in an object parameter `event`. Inside the function, the script extracts relevant data from the `event` object, such as `text`, `repo`, `filePath`, and `code`. It then performs various operations using the extracted data, including upserting a document in the database, retrieving the organization ID, creating documents using a text splitter, and embedding vectors using the `embedVectors` function. The resulting embedded vectors are returned as the output of the function.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `embedVectors(organizationId, event, chunks)`: This function takes in three parameters: `organizationId` (string), `event` (object), and `chunks` (array). It embeds vectors based on the provided organization ID, event, and chunks of text. It returns the embedded vectors.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with a database (using the `prisma` object) to upsert documents and retrieve organization and user information. It also uses a text splitter library (`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`) to create documents from the codebase text. Additionally, it uses a function (`embedVectors`) from another file to embed vectors based on the extracted data.

Developer Questions:
- How does the upsert operation work in the `prisma.document.upsert` function?
- What is the purpose of the `metadata` property in the document object?
- How does the `embedVectors` function embed vectors based on the provided data?
- What happens if the organization ID or user information is not found?
- How does the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` library split the text into chunks?
