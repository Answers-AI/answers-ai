Summary:
This code file contains several event handlers related to authentication and user settings synchronization. It imports necessary dependencies and defines event handlers for various authentication and user-related events. The code interacts with a database using Prisma and communicates with an external service called Inngest.

Import statements:
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module, which is likely a custom module for interacting with a database using Prisma.
- `syncAppSettings` is imported from the `../auth/syncAppSettings` module, which is likely a custom module for synchronizing user settings.
- `EventVersionHandler` is imported from the `./EventVersionHandler` module, which is likely a custom module defining a generic event handler class.
- `inngest` is imported from the `./client` module, which is likely a custom module for interacting with the Inngest service.

Script Summary:
The script defines several event handlers for authentication and user-related events. Each event handler has a version (`v`), an event name (`event`), and a handler function (`handler`). The handler functions are asynchronous and perform various operations related to user settings synchronization and data manipulation.

Internal Functions:
- `authSession`: This event handler is triggered when the event `auth/settings.sync` occurs. It expects an event object with a `user` property containing the user's ID. It synchronizes the user's settings using the `syncAppSettings` function and returns the settings.
- `syncAllSettings`: This event handler is triggered when the event `auth/settings.syncAll` occurs. It retrieves all users from the database using Prisma and creates an array of events to be sent to the Inngest service. Each event contains the user's ID and other relevant data. The events are then sent to Inngest using the `inngest.send` function.
- `authUserSignIn`: This event handler is triggered when the event `auth/user.signIn` occurs. It expects an event object with a `data` property and a `user` property containing the user's ID. It synchronizes the user's settings using the `syncAppSettings` function and returns the settings.
- `authUserLinkAccount`: This event handler is triggered when the event `auth/user.linkAccount` occurs. It expects an event object with a `data` property and a `user` property containing the user's ID. It synchronizes the user's settings using the `syncAppSettings` function and returns the settings.

External Functions:
- `syncAppSettings`: This function takes a `userId` parameter and synchronizes the user's settings. It likely performs some database operations to retrieve and update the settings.

Interaction Summary:
This code file interacts with a database using Prisma to retrieve user data. It also communicates with an external service called Inngest to send events related to user settings synchronization. The code relies on the `syncAppSettings` function to handle the synchronization of user settings.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the event names or add new event handlers?
- What other functions or modules are used by the `syncAppSettings` function?
- How can I handle errors or exceptions that occur during the event handling process?
- Are there any performance considerations when synchronizing settings for multiple users?
