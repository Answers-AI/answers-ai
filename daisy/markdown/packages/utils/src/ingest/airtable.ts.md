Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a broader software application. Its purpose is to process data from an Airtable database and send it to a service called Pinecone for further analysis. The script retrieves records from Airtable, generates a summary of each record, converts the records into a specific format required by Pinecone, and then sends the data to Pinecone in batches. The script is triggered by an event called 'airtable/app.sync' and is designed to be used with a specific API key and base ID.

Import statements:
- `import { inngest } from './client';`: This imports the `inngest` function from a file called 'client' in the current directory.
- `import Airtable from 'airtable';`: This imports the default export from the 'airtable' module.
- `import { EventVersionHandler } from './EventVersionHandler';`: This imports the `EventVersionHandler` class from a file called 'EventVersionHandler' in the current directory.
- `import { AirtableRecord } from 'types';`: This imports the `AirtableRecord` type from a module called 'types'.
- `import { chunkArray } from '../utilities/utils';`: This imports the `chunkArray` function from a file called 'utils' in the '../utilities' directory.

Internal Functions:
- `getNLPSummary(record: AirtableRecord)`: This function takes an `AirtableRecord` object as input and generates a summary string based on the record's fields. The summary includes information such as the record's summary, description, reporter, assignee, QA person, linked issues, and status. The function returns the generated summary string.
- `getAirtablePineconeObject(airtableRecords: AirtableRecord[])`: This async function takes an array of `AirtableRecord` objects as input and processes each record to generate an array of objects in a specific format required by Pinecone. The function uses the `getNLPSummary` function to generate the summary for each record. The function returns the array of processed objects.
- `embedVectors(event: any, vectors: any[])`: This async function takes an `event` object and an array of vectors as input. It sends the vectors to the Pinecone service in batches using the `inngest.send` function. The function returns an array of void values.
- `getAirtableRecords(base: any)`: This function takes a `base` object as input and retrieves all records from the Airtable database using the `base.select` method. The function returns a promise that resolves to an array of `AirtableRecord` objects.

External Functions:
- `processAirtable`: This is an object that serves as the event handler for the 'airtable/app.sync' event. It has a property called `handler` which is an async function that takes an `event` object as input. The function retrieves the API key and base ID from the `event.data` object, creates an instance of the Airtable class using the API key, and calls the `getAirtableRecords` function to retrieve all records from Airtable. It then calls the `getAirtablePineconeObject` function to process the records, and finally calls the `embedVectors` function to send the processed data to Pinecone.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Airtable API to retrieve records from a specific base and view. It also interacts with the Pinecone service to send the processed data in batches. The script is triggered by an event and requires an API key and base ID to function properly.

Developer Questions:
- How does the script handle errors when retrieving records from Airtable?
- What happens if the `getNLPSummary` function encounters a record with missing fields?
- How does the `embedVectors` function handle cases where the `vectors` array is empty or contains invalid values?
- What is the purpose of the `chunkArray` function and how does it work?
- How can I modify the script to process records from a different Airtable base or view?
