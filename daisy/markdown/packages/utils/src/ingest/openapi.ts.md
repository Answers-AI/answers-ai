Summary:
This code is a part of a software application that interacts with the OpenAPI Guru API to retrieve and process OpenAPI specifications. It includes functions to sync the OpenAPI specifications from the API, extract relevant information from the specifications, and send the extracted data to another service called "inngest". The code is written in TypeScript and uses the axios library for making HTTP requests.

Import statements:
- `axios`: A library for making HTTP requests.
- `URL`: A built-in module in Node.js for working with URLs.
- `inngest`: A module that provides a client for sending data to the "inngest" service.
- `openApiLoader`: A module for loading OpenAPI specifications.
- `EventVersionHandler`: A type definition for an event handler function.

Script Summary:
The script includes several functions and constants related to syncing and processing OpenAPI specifications. It defines three event handlers: `processOpenApiGuruList`, `processOpenApiDomainList`, and `processOpenApiUrl`. These event handlers are responsible for fetching OpenAPI specifications from the OpenAPI Guru API, extracting relevant information from the specifications, and sending the extracted data to the "inngest" service.

Internal Functions:
- `isDomainMatch(url1, url2)`: A function that checks if two URLs have the same domain.
- `getXOriginUrls(json, options)`: A function that extracts the URLs of OpenAPI specifications from a JSON object obtained from the OpenAPI Guru API.
- `prefixHeaders(markdown)`: A function that adds prefixes to the headers in a Markdown document.

External Functions:
- `processOpenApiGuruList`: An event handler function that fetches the OpenAPI Guru list, extracts the URLs of OpenAPI specifications, and sends the URLs to the "inngest" service.
- `processOpenApiDomainList`: An event handler function that fetches the OpenAPI Guru list, extracts the URLs of OpenAPI specifications for specific domains, and sends the URLs to the "inngest" service.
- `processOpenApiUrl`: An event handler function that loads OpenAPI specifications from the provided URLs, extracts relevant information from the specifications, and sends the extracted data to the "inngest" service.

Interaction Summary:
The script interacts with the OpenAPI Guru API to fetch the OpenAPI Guru list and retrieve OpenAPI specifications. It also interacts with the "inngest" service to send the extracted data from the OpenAPI specifications.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the event handlers to perform additional processing on the OpenAPI specifications?
- How can I customize the data sent to the "inngest" service?
- How can I handle errors that occur during the fetching and processing of OpenAPI specifications?
- How can I extend the script to support additional APIs or data sources?
