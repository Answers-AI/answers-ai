Summary:
This code is a part of a software application that interacts with the OpenAPI Guru API to retrieve and process OpenAPI specifications. It includes functions to sync the OpenAPI specifications from the API, extract relevant information from the specifications, and send the extracted data to another service called "inngest". The code also includes utility functions for manipulating and formatting the extracted data.

Import statements:
- `axios`: A library for making HTTP requests.
- `URL`: A built-in module for working with URLs.
- `inngest`: A module for sending data to the "inngest" service.
- `openApiLoader`: A module for loading OpenAPI specifications.
- `EventVersionHandler`: A type definition for event handlers.
- `chunkArray`: A utility function for splitting an array into smaller chunks.
- `OpenApiProvider`: A type definition for OpenAPI providers.
- `openApiToMarkdown`: A utility function for converting OpenAPI specifications to Markdown format.

Script Summary:
The script includes several functions for syncing and processing OpenAPI specifications. It defines three event handlers: `processOpenApiGuruList`, `processOpenApiDomainList`, and `processOpenApiUrl`. These handlers are triggered by specific events and perform different tasks related to syncing and processing OpenAPI specifications.

Internal Functions:
- `isDomainMatch`: A function that checks if two URLs have matching domains.
- `getXOriginUrls`: A function that extracts URLs from the OpenAPI specifications based on provided options.
- `prefixHeaders`: A function that adds prefixes to Markdown headers.

External Functions:
- `processOpenApiGuruList`: An event handler that syncs the OpenAPI specifications from the OpenAPI Guru API and sends the extracted URLs to the "inngest" service.
- `processOpenApiDomainList`: An event handler that syncs the OpenAPI specifications for specific domains and sends the extracted URLs to the "inngest" service.
- `processOpenApiUrl`: An event handler that processes the provided OpenAPI URLs, extracts relevant information, and sends the extracted data to the "inngest" service.

Interaction Summary:
The script interacts with the OpenAPI Guru API to retrieve a list of available OpenAPI specifications. It then processes the retrieved data to extract relevant URLs and information from the specifications. The extracted data is sent to the "inngest" service for further processing or storage.

Developer Questions:
- How can I trigger the `processOpenApiGuruList` event handler?
- What data should be provided to the `processOpenApiDomainList` event handler?
- How can I customize the behavior of the `processOpenApiUrl` event handler?
- How can I modify the extracted data before sending it to the "inngest" service?
- Are there any limitations or known issues with the OpenAPI specifications processing?
