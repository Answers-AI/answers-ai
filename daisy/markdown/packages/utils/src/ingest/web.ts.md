Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a broader software application. Its purpose is to scrape web pages and extract information from them. The script uses various libraries and functions to load web pages, parse HTML, extract URLs, convert web pages to markdown, split markdown into smaller chunks, and embed vectors into a vector index. It also includes event handlers for processing web page synchronization and scraping.

Import statements:
- `URL` from 'url': This import is used to parse and manipulate URLs.
- `cheerio` from 'cheerio': This import is used to parse and manipulate HTML.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from 'langchain/text_splitter': This import is a custom class used for splitting text into smaller chunks.
- `prisma` from '@db/client': This import is used to interact with the database.
- `inngest` from './client': This import is used to send data to an external service.
- `webPageLoader` from '../web': This import is a custom function used to load web pages.
- `convertWebPageToMarkdown` from '../web/getWebPage': This import is a custom function used to convert web pages to markdown.
- `EventVersionHandler` from './EventVersionHandler': This import is a custom class used for handling events.
- `WebPage` from 'types': This import is a custom type used to represent web pages.
- `extractUrlsFromSitemap` from '../utilities/getSitemapUrls': This import is a custom function used to extract URLs from a sitemap.
- `getUniqueUrls`, `getUniqueUrl` from '@utils/getUniqueUrls': These imports are custom functions used to get unique URLs.
- `chunkArray` from '../utilities/utils': This import is a custom function used to chunk an array into smaller arrays.
- `isAxiosError` from 'axios': This import is used to check if an error is an Axios error.
- `fetchSitemapUrls` from '../fetchSitemapUrls': This import is a custom function used to fetch sitemap URLs.
- `getPendingSyncURLs` from './getPendingSyncURLs': This import is a custom function used to get pending sync URLs.

Script Summary:
The script includes several utility functions for processing web pages, splitting markdown, and embedding vectors. It also includes event handlers for processing web page synchronization and scraping. The script uses various imports to perform these tasks.

Internal Functions:
- `prefixHeaders`: This function takes a markdown string as input and adds prefix headers to the headings based on their level.
- `splitPageHtmlChunkMore`: This async function takes a markdown chunk as input and splits it into smaller chunks using a recursive character text splitter.
- `splitPageHtml`: This async function takes a web page object as input, converts the web page to markdown, prefixes headers, and splits the markdown into smaller chunks.
- `scrapePage`: This async generator function takes a URL, origin, and a set of URLs as input and recursively scrapes web pages, extracting URLs and yielding them.
- `getUniqueDomains`: This function takes an array of URLs as input and returns an array of unique domain URLs.
- `getWebPagesVectors`: This async function takes an array of web pages as input, splits the web pages into smaller chunks, and returns an array of vectors.
- `embedVectors`: This async function takes an event and an array of vectors as input, sends the vectors to an external service in batches, and returns the result.

External Functions:
- `processWebUrlScrape`: This event handler function processes web page synchronization by sending the URLs to the external service.
- `processWebDomainScrape`: This event handler function processes web domain synchronization by fetching URLs from sitemaps and sending them to the external service.
- `processWebDeepScrape`: This event handler function processes deep web page synchronization by recursively scraping web pages and sending them to the external service.
- `processWebScrape`: This event handler function processes web page scraping by loading web pages, converting them to markdown, splitting them into smaller chunks, and embedding vectors into a vector index.

Interaction Summary:
The script interacts with the database, an external service, and various utility functions and libraries. It loads web pages, parses HTML, extracts URLs, converts web pages to markdown, splits markdown into smaller chunks, and embeds vectors into a vector index. It also handles events related to web page synchronization and scraping.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the script to handle different types of web pages or extract different information?
- How can I handle errors or exceptions that occur during web page scraping or synchronization?
- How can I optimize the performance of the script when processing a large number of web pages or URLs?
- How can I extend the script to support additional functionality or integrate with other systems or services?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with the script that need to be addressed?
