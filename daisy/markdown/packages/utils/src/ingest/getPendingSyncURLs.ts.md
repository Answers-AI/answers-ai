Summary:
This code is a module that exports a function called `getPendingSyncURLs`. The purpose of this function is to receive an array of URLs and return an array of URLs that are pending synchronization. It does this by performing database operations using the Prisma ORM.

Import statements:
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. This is likely a custom module that provides a connection to the database and exposes the Prisma client.
- `getUrlDomain` is imported from the `../getUrlDomain` module. This is likely a utility function that extracts the domain from a given URL.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single function called `getPendingSyncURLs`. This function takes an array of URLs as input and performs the following steps:
1. Normalize the URLs by converting them to lowercase.
2. Create new documents in the database using the Prisma client. Each document represents a URL and includes the URL itself, its domain (extracted using `getUrlDomain`), source, status, and lastSyncedAt properties.
3. Retrieve pending sync documents from the database using the Prisma client. The query filters the documents based on the following conditions:
   - The URL is in the normalized URLs array.
   - One of the following conditions is true:
     - 60 minutes have passed since the last synchronization.
     - The status is 'pending'.
     - The lastSyncedAt property is null.
4. Extract the URLs from the retrieved documents and return them as the result.

Internal Functions:
- `getPendingSyncURLs`: This is the main function of the script. It takes an array of URLs as input and returns an array of URLs that are pending synchronization.

External Functions:
- `getUrlDomain`: This function is imported from another module. It takes a URL as input and returns the domain part of the URL.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the database using the Prisma client to create and retrieve documents. It also depends on the `getUrlDomain` function to extract the domain from URLs. The script can be used as a standalone module or integrated into a larger application that utilizes the Prisma ORM and requires URL synchronization functionality.

Developer Questions:
- How does the `prisma` module connect to the database?
- What is the structure of the `document` table in the database?
- How is the `getUrlDomain` function implemented?
- How can I handle errors that may occur during database operations?
- How can I modify the query conditions to retrieve different sets of pending sync URLs?
- How can I optimize the performance of this script when dealing with a large number of URLs?
