Summary:
This code defines a class called "SlackObject" that extends the "AnswersObject" class. It also includes a static method called "convertTimestampToDate" that converts a timestamp to a JavaScript Date object.

Import statements:
The code imports the "AnswersObject" class from a file located at "../../core/models/answersObject".

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called "SlackObject" that extends the "AnswersObject" class. It includes a constructor that calls the parent class's constructor. It also includes a static method called "convertTimestampToDate" that takes a timestamp as input and returns a JavaScript Date object.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(object): This is the constructor of the "SlackObject" class. It calls the constructor of the parent class ("AnswersObject") with the "object" parameter.

- convertTimestampToDate(timestamp): This is a static method that takes a timestamp as input and converts it to a JavaScript Date object. It first checks if the timestamp is falsy and returns null if it is. Then, it removes the microseconds from the timestamp by splitting it at the dot and taking the first part. It converts the resulting string to an integer using "parseInt". If the conversion fails and returns NaN, it throws an error. Finally, it creates a new Date object by multiplying the converted timestamp by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds and returns the date.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script is a standalone file that defines the "SlackObject" class. It can be used by other parts of the application that need to work with Slack-related data. Other parts of the application can create instances of the "SlackObject" class and use its methods, such as "convertTimestampToDate", to manipulate Slack data.

Developer Questions:
- How do I create an instance of the "SlackObject" class?
- How do I use the "convertTimestampToDate" method?
- What happens if I pass an invalid timestamp to the "convertTimestampToDate" method?
- Can I override any methods of the parent class in the "SlackObject" class?
