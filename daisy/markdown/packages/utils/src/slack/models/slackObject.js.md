Summary:
This code defines a class called "SlackObject" that extends the "AnswersObject" class. It also includes a static method called "convertTimestampToDate" that converts a timestamp to a JavaScript Date object.

Import statements:
The code imports the "AnswersObject" class from a file located at "../../core/models/answersObject".

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called "SlackObject" that extends the "AnswersObject" class. It includes a constructor that calls the parent class's constructor. It also includes a static method called "convertTimestampToDate" that takes a timestamp as input and returns a JavaScript Date object.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- convertTimestampToDate(timestamp): This static method takes a timestamp as input and converts it to a JavaScript Date object. It first checks if the timestamp is falsy and returns null if it is. It then removes the microseconds from the timestamp by splitting it at the "." character and taking the first part. It converts the resulting string to an integer using parseInt(). If the resulting integer is NaN, it throws an error. Finally, it multiplies the integer by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds and creates a new Date object with the resulting value. It returns the Date object.

Interaction Summary:
This script is a standalone file that defines the "SlackObject" class. It can be used by other parts of the application that need to work with Slack-related data. Other parts of the application can create instances of the "SlackObject" class and call its methods, such as "convertTimestampToDate", to perform specific operations on Slack data.

Developer Questions:
- How do I create an instance of the "SlackObject" class?
- How do I use the "convertTimestampToDate" method to convert a timestamp to a Date object?
- What happens if the timestamp is invalid or missing?
