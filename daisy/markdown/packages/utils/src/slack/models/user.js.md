Summary:
This code defines a class called "SlackUser" that represents a user in the Slack application. The class has a constructor that takes a Slack API client and a user ID as parameters. It also has a cache property to store information about the user. The class has two methods: "getInfo" and "real_name_normalized". The "getInfo" method retrieves information about the user from the Slack API and caches it for future use. The "real_name_normalized" method returns the normalized real name of the user.

Import statements:
- "SlackObject" is imported from the "./slackObject" module. It is not used in this code snippet.

Script Summary:
This script defines a class called "SlackUser" that represents a user in the Slack application. It provides methods to retrieve information about the user and access their normalized real name.

Internal Functions:
- constructor(slackApiClient, userId): Initializes a new instance of the SlackUser class with the provided Slack API client and user ID. It also initializes the cache property.
- getInfo(): Retrieves information about the user from the Slack API. If the information is already cached, it returns the cached value. Otherwise, it makes an API call to fetch the information, caches it, and returns it.
- get real_name_normalized(): Returns a promise that resolves to the normalized real name of the user. It calls the getInfo() method and extracts the real_name_normalized property from the returned user information.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script represents a user in the Slack application and provides methods to retrieve information about the user. It can be used by other parts of the application that need to work with user data, such as displaying user information or performing actions on behalf of a user.

Developer Questions:
- How can I create an instance of the SlackUser class?
- How can I retrieve information about a user?
- How can I access the normalized real name of a user?
- Can I modify the cache property to store additional user information?
- How can I handle errors when making API calls to retrieve user information?
