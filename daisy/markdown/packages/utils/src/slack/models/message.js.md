Summary:
The code defines a class called "SlackMessage" that represents a message in the Slack messaging platform. The class provides methods to retrieve information about the message, such as its content, sender, and replies. It also includes a static method to replace user mentions in a message with the corresponding user's real name.

Import statements:
- `SlackObject` is imported from the './slackObject' module. It is likely a custom module that provides utility functions related to Slack objects.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called "SlackMessage" with a constructor and several methods. The constructor initializes the class with the necessary properties, such as the Slack API client, channel, message, and parent message. The class also maintains a cache object to store retrieved information for future use.

Internal Functions:
- `getInfo()`: This method retrieves information about the message from the Slack API. It first checks if the information is already cached and returns it if available. Otherwise, it makes an API call to fetch the message's details from the channel's history. If the message is not found, an error is thrown. The retrieved information is then stored in the cache and returned.
- `getTidiedInfo()`: This method retrieves tidied information about the message, such as its text, date sent, date edited, and user. It calls the `getInfo()` method to fetch the message's details and performs additional processing to format the information. The tidied information is stored in the cache and returned.
- `getReplies()`: This method retrieves the replies to the message from the Slack API. It first checks if the replies are already cached and returns them if available. Otherwise, it makes an API call to fetch the replies from the channel. The retrieved replies are then converted into `SlackMessage` objects and stored in the cache before being returned.
- `getUserName(messageInfo)`: This method retrieves the username associated with the message. If the message is from a bot, it returns the bot's username or 'Unknown bot' if not available. If the message is from a user, it calls the Slack API to fetch the user's details and returns their real name or 'Unknown User' if not available.

External Functions:
- `replaceUserMentions(message, slackApiClient)`: This static method replaces user mentions in a message with the corresponding user's real name. It takes a message string and a Slack API client as parameters. It uses a regular expression to find user mentions in the message and replaces them with the real names fetched from the Slack API.

Interaction Summary:
The "SlackMessage" class can interact with the rest of the application by providing methods to retrieve information about a Slack message, including its content, sender, and replies. Developers can use these methods to display message details, perform actions based on message content, or analyze message threads.
