Summary:
The code defines a class called "SlackMessage" that represents a message in the Slack messaging platform. The class has methods to retrieve information about the message, such as its content, sender, and replies. It also provides a static method to replace user mentions in a message with the corresponding user's real name.

Import statements:
- `SlackObject` is imported from the './slackObject' module. It is likely a custom module that provides utility functions related to Slack objects.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called "SlackMessage" with several methods. The constructor initializes the class with the necessary properties, such as the Slack API client, channel, message, and parent message. The class also has methods to retrieve information about the message, tidy up the information, and retrieve replies to the message. Additionally, there is a static method to replace user mentions in a message.

Internal Functions:
- `getInfo()`: This method retrieves information about the message from the Slack API. It first checks if the information is already cached and returns it if available. Otherwise, it makes an API call to fetch the message information based on the channel and timestamp. If the message is not found, an error is thrown. The retrieved message is then cached and returned.
- `getTidiedInfo()`: This method retrieves tidied information about the message. It first checks if the tidied information is already cached and returns it if available. Otherwise, it calls the `getInfo()` method to fetch the message information. It then transforms the information into a tidied format, including the message text, date sent, date edited (if applicable), and the user who sent the message. The tidied information is cached and returned.
- `getReplies()`: This method retrieves the replies to the message. It first checks if the replies are already cached and returns them if available. Otherwise, it makes an API call to fetch the replies based on the channel and timestamp. The retrieved replies are then transformed into instances of the `SlackMessage` class and cached before being returned.
- `getUserName(messageInfo)`: This method retrieves the username of the user who sent the message. If the message was sent by a bot, it returns the bot's username or 'Unknown bot' if not available. If the message does not have a user associated with it, it returns 'Unknown user'. Otherwise, it makes an API call to fetch the user's information and returns their real name or 'Unknown User' if not available.

External Functions:
- `replaceUserMentions(message, slackApiClient)`: This static method replaces user mentions in a message with the corresponding user's real name. It takes the message string and the Slack API client as parameters. It uses a regular expression to find user mentions in the format "<@userId>". For each mention, it makes an API call to fetch the user's information and replaces the mention with their real name. The modified message is then returned.

Interaction Summary:
The "SlackMessage" class can be used to retrieve information about a message in the Slack platform, including its content, sender, and replies. It can also be used to replace user mentions in a message with the corresponding user's real name. This class can be integrated into a larger software application that interacts with the Slack API to perform various tasks related to messaging and collaboration.
