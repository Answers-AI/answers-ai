Summary:
The code provided is a module that represents a Slack channel. It contains a class called `SlackChannel` that has methods for retrieving information about the channel and its messages. The class takes a Slack API client and a channel object as parameters in its constructor. It also has a cache object to store retrieved information for future use.

Import statements:
- `import SlackMessage from './message';`: This imports the `SlackMessage` class from a file called `message.js`. It is used to create instances of `SlackMessage` within the `SlackChannel` class.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called `SlackChannel` that represents a Slack channel. It has a constructor that takes a Slack API client and a channel object as parameters. The constructor initializes the `slackApiClient`, `channelId`, and `cache` properties of the class. The `slackApiClient` is used to make API calls to retrieve information about the channel and its messages. The `channelId` is the ID of the channel. The `cache` object is used to store retrieved information for future use.

The class has two methods: `getInfo()` and `getMessages()`. The `getInfo()` method retrieves information about the channel and returns it. It first checks if the channel information is already stored in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached information. Otherwise, it makes an API call to retrieve the channel information, stores it in the cache, and returns it.

The `getMessages()` method retrieves the messages in the channel and returns them as an array of `SlackMessage` instances. It first checks if the messages are already stored in the cache. If they are, it returns the cached messages. Otherwise, it retrieves the messages using pagination. It initializes an empty array called `messages` to store the retrieved messages. It then enters a loop that makes API calls to retrieve messages until there are no more messages to retrieve. Within the loop, it creates a `SlackMessage` instance for each retrieved message and adds it to the `messages` array. If the message contains mentioned user IDs, it replaces the user IDs with user objects in the cache. Finally, it updates the cache with the retrieved messages and returns them.

Internal Functions:
- `getInfo()`: This method retrieves information about the channel. It first checks if the channel information is already stored in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached information. Otherwise, it makes an API call to retrieve the channel information, stores it in the cache, and returns it.

- `getMessages()`: This method retrieves the messages in the channel. It first checks if the messages are already stored in the cache. If they are, it returns the cached messages. Otherwise, it retrieves the messages using pagination. It initializes an empty array called `messages` to store the retrieved messages. It then enters a loop that makes API calls to retrieve messages until there are no more messages to retrieve. Within the loop, it creates a `SlackMessage` instance for each retrieved message and adds it to the `messages` array. If the message contains mentioned user IDs, it replaces the user IDs with user objects in the cache. Finally, it updates the cache with the retrieved messages and returns them.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application to retrieve information about a Slack channel and its messages. It requires a Slack API client and a channel object to be passed to its constructor. Other parts of the application can create an instance of the `SlackChannel` class and call its methods to retrieve channel information and messages.

Developer Questions:
- How do I create an instance of the `SlackChannel` class?
- How do I pass the Slack API client and channel object to the `SlackChannel` constructor?
- How do I retrieve channel information using the `getInfo()` method?
- How do I retrieve messages using the `getMessages()` method?
- How do I handle pagination when retrieving messages?
- How do I replace mentioned user IDs with user objects in the cache?
