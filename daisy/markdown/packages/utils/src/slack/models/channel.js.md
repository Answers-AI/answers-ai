Summary:
The code provided is a module that represents a Slack channel. It contains a class called `SlackChannel` that has methods for retrieving information about the channel and its messages. The class uses an instance of the `SlackMessage` class to represent individual messages in the channel. The module exports the `SlackChannel` class as the default export.

Import statements:
- `import SlackMessage from './message';`: This imports the `SlackMessage` class from a file called `message.js` in the same directory.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called `SlackChannel` that represents a Slack channel. It has a constructor that takes two parameters: `slackApiClient` (an instance of a Slack API client) and `channel` (an object representing the channel). The constructor initializes the `slackApiClient`, `channelId`, and `cache` properties of the class.

The class has two async methods: `getInfo()` and `getMessages()`. The `getInfo()` method retrieves information about the channel from the Slack API. It first checks if the channel information is already cached and returns it if it is. Otherwise, it makes a request to the Slack API to get the channel information, updates the cache, and returns the channel information.

The `getMessages()` method retrieves the messages in the channel from the Slack API. It first checks if the messages are already cached and returns them if they are. Otherwise, it initializes an empty array to store the messages. It then uses a do-while loop to paginate through the messages using the `conversations.history()` method of the Slack API. For each message, it creates an instance of the `SlackMessage` class, adds it to the messages array, and checks if the message mentions any users. If a user is mentioned, it replaces the user ID with the user's real name in the message text. The loop continues until there are no more messages to retrieve. Finally, it updates the cache with the messages and returns them.

Internal Functions:
- `constructor(slackApiClient, channel)`: The constructor of the `SlackChannel` class. It initializes the `slackApiClient`, `channelId`, and `cache` properties of the class.
- `async getInfo()`: An async method that retrieves information about the channel from the Slack API. It checks if the channel information is already cached and returns it if it is. Otherwise, it makes a request to the Slack API to get the channel information, updates the cache, and returns the channel information.
- `async getMessages()`: An async method that retrieves the messages in the channel from the Slack API. It checks if the messages are already cached and returns them if they are. Otherwise, it initializes an empty array to store the messages. It then uses a do-while loop to paginate through the messages using the `conversations.history()` method of the Slack API. For each message, it creates an instance of the `SlackMessage` class, adds it to the messages array, and checks if the message mentions any users. If a user is mentioned, it replaces the user ID with the user's real name in the message text. The loop continues until there are no more messages to retrieve. Finally, it updates the cache with the messages and returns them.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This module represents a Slack channel and provides methods to retrieve information about the channel and its messages. It interacts with the Slack API client to make requests and retrieve data. Other parts of the application can use an instance of the `SlackChannel` class to retrieve channel information and messages.

Developer Questions:
- How do I create an instance of the `SlackChannel` class?
- How do I retrieve channel information using the `getInfo()` method?
- How do I retrieve messages in a channel using the `getMessages()` method?
- How do I handle errors when making requests to the Slack API?
- How do I handle pagination when retrieving messages from the Slack API?
