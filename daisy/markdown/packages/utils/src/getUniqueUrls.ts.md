Summary:
This code provides two functions for manipulating URLs: `getUniqueUrl` and `getUniqueUrls`. The `getUniqueUrl` function takes a URL as input and returns a modified version of the URL with the hostname and path combined. The `getUniqueUrls` function takes an array of URLs and returns an array of unique modified URLs using the `getUniqueUrl` function.

Import statements:
There are no import statements in this code.

Script Summary:
This script exports two functions: `getUniqueUrl` and `getUniqueUrls`. These functions are used to manipulate URLs by removing trailing slashes and combining the hostname and path.

Internal Functions:
- `getUniqueUrl(url: string)`: This function takes a URL as input and returns a modified version of the URL. It first creates a new `URL` object from the input URL. Then, it extracts the hostname from the parsed URL and removes any leading "www." using a regular expression. Next, it extracts the path from the parsed URL and removes any trailing slashes using another regular expression. Finally, it combines the modified hostname and path with "https://" and returns the result.

External Functions:
- `getUniqueUrls(urls: string[])`: This function takes an array of URLs as input and returns an array of unique modified URLs. It uses the `getUniqueUrl` function to modify each URL in the input array and then uses the `Array.from` and `Set` functions to remove duplicates from the modified URLs.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility module in a larger software application that needs to manipulate URLs. Other modules or components can import and use the `getUniqueUrl` and `getUniqueUrls` functions to modify and filter URLs.

Developer Questions:
- How does the `getUniqueUrl` function handle querystrings and hashes in the URL?
- Can the `getUniqueUrls` function handle large arrays of URLs efficiently?
- Are there any performance considerations when using the `Array.from` and `Set` functions in the `getUniqueUrls` function?
- Can the `getUniqueUrl` function handle URLs with non-standard schemes (e.g., "ftp://")?
