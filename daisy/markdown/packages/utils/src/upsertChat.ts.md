The function uses the Prisma library to interact with the database and perform the necessary operations.

Import statements:

Script Summary:
The "upsertChat" function is an asynchronous function that creates or updates a chat object in the database. It takes in various parameters such as the chat ID, user information, filters, prompt, and journey ID. The function first checks if a journey ID is provided. If it is, it updates the journey object in the database with the provided filters and connects the user to it. Then, it creates an object called "chatProperties" that contains the necessary data for creating or updating a chat object. This includes the title, users, filters, and messages. If a journey object was updated earlier, the journey ID is added to the chatProperties object. Finally, the function uses the Prisma client to either create a new chat object or update an existing one in the database, and returns the resulting chat object.
