Summary:
This code file is responsible for initializing and providing access to the OpenAI API. It also defines functions for creating chat chains and handling chat interactions. The code imports various dependencies and exports the necessary functions and variables for use in other parts of the application.

Import statements:
- `Message` and `User` from 'types': These are custom types used to define the structure of chat messages and user information.
- `Configuration` and `OpenAIApi` from 'openai': These are classes provided by the 'openai' package for configuring and interacting with the OpenAI API.
- `rawPrompt`, `summarizeQAPrompt`, and `summarizePrompt` from './chatPrompt' and './summarizePrompt': These are variables that contain predefined prompts for chat and summarization tasks.
- `getCompletionRequest` from './getCompletionRequest': This is a function that generates a completion request object for the OpenAI API.

Script Summary:
The script initializes the OpenAI API by creating an instance of the `OpenAIApi` class with the provided API key. It exports this instance as `openai` for use in other parts of the application. It also defines a function `createChatChain` that creates a chat chain object with the provided messages. The chat chain object has a `call` method that handles chat interactions by sending a completion request to the OpenAI API and returning the response.

Internal Functions:
- `initializeOpenAI`: This function initializes the OpenAI API by creating an instance of the `OpenAIApi` class with the provided API key. It returns the initialized `OpenAIApi` instance.

External Functions:
- `createChatChain`: This function creates a chat chain object with the provided messages. The chat chain object has a `call` method that handles chat interactions by sending a completion request to the OpenAI API and returning the response.

Interaction Summary:
This code file interacts with the OpenAI API to perform chat interactions. It provides functions for creating chat chains and handling chat interactions. Other parts of the application can use these functions to integrate chat functionality.
