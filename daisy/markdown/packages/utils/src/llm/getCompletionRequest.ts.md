Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that exports a single function called `getCompletionRequest`. The function takes in several parameters, including `context`, `user`, `organization`, `messages`, `input`, `sidekick`, and `gptModel`. It performs various operations to generate a completion request object that can be used with an AI model to generate a response.

Import statements:
- `Message`, `Sidekick`, `User`, and `Organization` are imported from the 'types' module. These types likely define the structure of message objects, sidekick objects, user objects, and organization objects.
- `ChatCompletionRequestMessageRoleEnum` is imported from the 'openai' module. This enum likely defines the different roles that a message can have in a chat completion request.
- `countTokens` is imported from the '../utilities/countTokens' module. This function likely counts the number of tokens in a given text string.
- `renderContext` is imported from the '../utilities/renderContext' module. This function likely renders a template string with the provided context variables.
- `getMaxTokensByModel` is imported from the '../utilities/getMaxTokensByModel' module. This function likely returns the maximum number of tokens allowed for a given AI model.
- `getUserContextFields` is imported from the '../utilities/getUserContextFields' module. This function likely retrieves custom context fields for a user.
- `getOrganizationContextFields` is imported from the '../utilities/getOrganizationContextFields' module. This function likely retrieves custom context fields for an organization.

Script Summary:
The `getCompletionRequest` function is an asynchronous function that generates a completion request object based on the provided parameters. It performs several operations, including retrieving custom context fields for the user and organization, rendering system and user prompts with the provided templates and context variables, calculating token counts, filtering messages based on token count, and constructing the final completion request object.

Internal Functions:
- `getCompletionRequest`: This is the main function of the script. It takes in several parameters and returns a completion request object. It performs various operations, including retrieving custom context fields, rendering prompts, calculating token counts, filtering messages, and constructing the completion request object.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a utility function to generate completion request objects for interacting with an AI model. It takes in various parameters, including user and organization information, messages, input text, sidekick configuration, and AI model selection. The generated completion request object can then be used to make API calls to the AI model and receive a response.

Developer Questions:
- How are the custom context fields for the user and organization retrieved?
- What is the purpose of the `countTokens` function and how does it work?
- How are the system and user prompts rendered with the provided templates and context variables?
- How are messages filtered based on token count and what is the maximum number of tokens allowed?
- How is the final completion request object constructed and what parameters are included?
