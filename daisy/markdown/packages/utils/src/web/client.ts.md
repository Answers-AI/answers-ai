Summary:
This code defines a class called `WebClient` that is responsible for fetching web data from a given URL. It uses the `axios` library to make HTTP requests and the `puppeteer` library to scrape web pages. The fetched data can be cached using Redis for a specified amount of time. The class has a single method called `fetchWebData` that takes a URL and an optional cache flag as parameters and returns the fetched data.

Import statements:
- `axios` is imported to make HTTP requests.
- `puppeteer` is imported to scrape web pages.
- `redis` is imported from a custom Redis client module.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called `WebClient` that fetches web data from a given URL. It uses `axios` to make HTTP requests and `puppeteer` to scrape web pages. The fetched data can be cached using Redis. The class has a single method called `fetchWebData` that takes a URL and an optional cache flag as parameters and returns the fetched data.

Internal Functions:
- `constructor`: Initializes the `WebClient` class with an optional cache expiration time. Sets the default headers for HTTP requests.
- `fetchWebData`: Fetches web data from a given URL. It first checks if the data is available in the cache. If not, it makes an HTTP request to the URL using `axios`. If the response status is not 200, an error is thrown. It then checks if the page is fully loaded with JavaScript enabled by checking the length of the stripped HTML. If the page is not fully loaded, it uses `puppeteer` to load the page and fetch the content. If caching is enabled, it stores the fetched data in Redis with an expiration time. Finally, it returns the fetched data.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used by other parts of the application to fetch web data from a given URL. The `fetchWebData` method can be called with the URL and an optional cache flag to fetch the data. The fetched data can be used for further processing or display.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use the `WebClient` class to fetch web data?
- What happens if the HTTP request fails or returns a non-200 status code?
- How can I enable or disable caching of the fetched data?
- How can I modify the default headers for HTTP requests?
- How can I change the cache expiration time?
- How can I handle errors when fetching web data?
- How can I integrate this script with other parts of the application?
