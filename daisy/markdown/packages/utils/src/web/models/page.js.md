Summary:
The given code is a JavaScript module that defines a class called "WebPage" which extends another class called "WebObject". The purpose of this script is to create a representation of a web page object, with properties such as URL, content, and metadata. The script also includes a helper function called "createContext" which is used to generate a string representation of the web page object.

Import statements:
- The code imports the "WebObject" class from a file called "webObject.js". This indicates that the "WebPage" class is dependent on the functionality provided by the "WebObject" class.

Script Summary:
The script defines a class called "WebPage" which extends the "WebObject" class. The constructor of the "WebPage" class takes a "webPage" object as a parameter and initializes the "tidiedPage" variable by calling the "tidy" static method of the "WebPage" class. The "tidy" method extracts the URL and HTML content from the "webPage" object and creates a new object with properties such as "objectType", "url", and "content". The "tidiedPage" object is then passed to the constructor of the "WebObject" class using the "super" keyword. Additional properties such as "objectType", "uid", and "url" are set on the "this.object" property of the "WebObject" instance.

The script also exports the "WebPage" class as the default export, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

Internal Functions:
- tidy(webPage): This static method takes a "webPage" object as a parameter and returns a tidied version of the object. It extracts the URL and HTML content from the "webPage" object and creates a new object with properties such as "objectType", "url", and "content". The tidied object is then returned.

External Functions:
- createContext(id, metadata): This function takes an "id" and "metadata" object as parameters and returns a string representation of the context. It concatenates the "id" with the metadata properties using a template string and returns the resulting string.

Interaction Summary:
The "WebPage" class extends the "WebObject" class, indicating that it inherits and extends the functionality provided by the "WebObject" class. This suggests that the "WebPage" class is part of a larger software application that deals with web objects and their representations. Other parts of the application may interact with the "WebPage" class by creating instances of it, accessing its properties, and calling its methods.

Developer Questions:
- How can I create an instance of the "WebPage" class?
To create an instance of the "WebPage" class, you can use the "new" keyword followed by the class name and pass a "webPage" object as a parameter to the constructor.

- How can I access the properties of a "WebPage" instance?
You can access the properties of a "WebPage" instance using dot notation. For example, if you have a "webPage" instance called "page", you can access its URL property using "page.url".

- How can I modify the behavior of the "WebPage" class?
To modify the behavior of the "WebPage" class, you can extend it further and override its methods. You can also add additional methods or properties to the class.

- How can I use the "createContext" function?
To use the "createContext" function, you can call it and pass an "id" and "metadata" object as parameters. It will return a string representation of the context based on the provided inputs.
