Summary:
This code is a module that converts a web page into markdown format. It uses various libraries and functions to parse the HTML, remove unwanted elements, convert the content to markdown, and extract relevant information such as the page title and description. The module exports two main functions: `convertWebPageToMarkdown` and `getWebPageHtml`.

Import statements:
- `webClient` from `'./index'`: This imports the `webClient` object from the `index` module in the current directory.
- `WebPage` from `'types'`: This imports the `WebPage` type from the `'types'` module.
- `cheerio` from `'cheerio'`: This imports the `cheerio` library, which provides a jQuery-like API for parsing and manipulating HTML.
- `NodeHtmlMarkdown` from `'node-html-markdown'`: This imports the `NodeHtmlMarkdown` class from the `'node-html-markdown'` module, which is used to convert HTML to markdown.
- `Readability` from `'@mozilla/readability'`: This imports the `Readability` class from the `'@mozilla/readability'` module, which is used to extract the main content of a web page.
- `JSDOM` from `'jsdom'`: This imports the `JSDOM` class from the `'jsdom'` module, which is used to create a virtual DOM for parsing and manipulating HTML.
- `showdown` from `'showdown'`: This imports the `showdown` library, which is used to convert markdown to HTML.
- `ConverterOptions` from `'showdown'`: This imports the `ConverterOptions` type from the `'showdown'` module.

Script Summary:
The script starts by defining some options for the `showdown` library. These options configure the behavior of the markdown to HTML conversion process.

Next, there is a function `convertMarkdownToHtml` that takes a markdown string and optional options, and returns the corresponding HTML string. It uses the `showdown` library to perform the conversion.

After that, there is a commented out function `removeDuplicateHeaders` that is not currently used in the code. It appears to be a function for removing duplicate headers from a markdown string.

Then, there is an array `excludeSelectors` that contains a list of CSS selectors for elements that should be excluded from the parsed HTML.

The script exports two main functions:
- `convertWebPageToMarkdown`: This function takes a URL and the HTML content of a web page, and returns a `WebPage` object containing the URL, domain, title, description, and content of the page in markdown format. The function uses the `cheerio` library to parse and manipulate the HTML, the `NodeHtmlMarkdown` class to convert the initial HTML to markdown, and the `Readability` class to extract the main content of the page. It also uses the `JSDOM` class to create a virtual DOM for further manipulation, and the `convertMarkdownToHtml` function to convert the initial markdown to HTML.
- `getWebPageHtml`: This function takes a URL and returns the HTML content of the web page. It uses the `webClient` object from the `index` module to fetch the web page data.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application to convert web pages into markdown format. The `convertWebPageToMarkdown` function can be called with a URL and the HTML content of a web page, and it will return a `WebPage` object with the relevant information in markdown format. The `getWebPageHtml` function can be used to fetch the HTML content of a web page.
