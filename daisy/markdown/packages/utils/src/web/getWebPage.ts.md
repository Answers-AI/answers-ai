Summary:
This code is a module that converts a web page into markdown format. It uses various libraries and functions to parse the HTML, remove unwanted elements, convert the HTML to markdown, and clean up the resulting markdown. The module exports two functions: `convertWebPageToMarkdown` and `getWebPageHtml`. The former takes a URL and the HTML content of a web page and returns a `WebPage` object containing the URL, domain, title, description, and content in markdown format. The latter function takes a URL and fetches the HTML content of the web page using a `webClient` object.

Import statements:
- `webClient` is imported from the `index` module. It is used to fetch the HTML content of a web page.
- `WebPage` is imported from the `types` module. It is used to define the structure of the `WebPage` object.
- `cheerio` is imported. It is a library that provides a jQuery-like API for parsing and manipulating HTML.
- `NodeHtmlMarkdown` is imported from the `node-html-markdown` module. It is used to convert HTML to markdown.
- `Readability` is imported from the `@mozilla/readability` module. It is used to extract the main content of a web page.
- `JSDOM` is imported from the `jsdom` module. It is used to create a virtual DOM for parsing and manipulating HTML.
- `showdown` is imported. It is a library that converts markdown to HTML.

Script Summary:
The script defines a set of options for the `showdown` library, which specify how the markdown should be converted to HTML. It also defines a function `convertMarkdownToHtml` that takes a markdown string and converts it to HTML using the `showdown` library. The script also defines a constant `excludeSelectors` that contains a list of CSS selectors for elements that should be excluded from the parsed HTML.

The script exports two functions: `convertWebPageToMarkdown` and `getWebPageHtml`. The former takes a URL and the HTML content of a web page, and performs the following steps:
1. Uses `cheerio` to load the HTML content and remove elements matching the CSS selectors in `excludeSelectors`.
2. Replaces all `<a>` tags with their inner HTML, effectively removing the links.
3. Translates the modified HTML to markdown using `NodeHtmlMarkdown`.
4. Converts the markdown to HTML using `showdown` and the options defined earlier.
5. Uses `cheerio` to load the resulting HTML and modify the `<h1>` tags to `<h2>`.
6. Groups consecutive `<h2>` tags and their siblings into `<section>` tags.
7. If no `<h2>` tags are found, wraps the entire content in a `<section>` tag.
8. Removes all elements from the `<body>` that are not `<section>` tags.
9. Creates a virtual DOM using `JSDOM` and the modified HTML.
10. Uses `Readability` to parse the main content of the web page from the virtual DOM.
11. Translates the parsed content to markdown using `NodeHtmlMarkdown`.
12. Extracts the domain from the URL and returns a `WebPage` object containing the URL, domain, title, description, and content in markdown format.

The `getWebPageHtml` function takes a URL and fetches the HTML content of the web page using the `webClient` object. It returns the fetched HTML content.

Internal Functions:
- `convertMarkdownToHtml`: Converts a markdown string to HTML using the `showdown` library. It takes a markdown string and an optional set of options, and returns the converted HTML string.

External Functions:
- `convertWebPageToMarkdown`: Converts a web page to markdown format. It takes a URL and the HTML content of the web page, and returns a `WebPage` object containing the URL, domain, title, description, and content in markdown format.
- `getWebPageHtml`: Fetches the HTML content of a web page. It takes an object with a `url` property, and returns a promise that resolves to the fetched HTML content.

Interaction Summary:
This module can be used by other parts of the application to convert web pages into markdown format. It provides a function `convertWebPageToMarkdown` that takes a URL and the HTML content of a web page, and returns a `WebPage` object containing the converted markdown. The module also provides a function `getWebPageHtml` that can be used to fetch the HTML content of a web page.
