**Prompt:** Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

**File Contents:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es2021"],
    "module": "ES2020",
    "target": "es2021",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "extends": "./base.json",
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

**Summary:**
The provided configuration file is used to specify various options and settings for the compiler in a larger application. It includes settings related to the version of ECMAScript, module system, strictness, module resolution, and more. The file also extends another configuration file called "base.json" and excludes the "node_modules" directory from compilation.

**Service:**
The configuration file is not specific to a known service. It is a general configuration file used in JavaScript or TypeScript projects to define compiler options.

**Configuration Summary:**
This configuration file overrides the default compiler options and sets them to specific values. It extends another configuration file called "base.json" and excludes the "node_modules" directory from compilation.

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `compilerOptions`: This section contains various compiler options that affect the behavior of the JavaScript or TypeScript compiler. The options include:
  - `lib`: Specifies the library files to be included in the compilation. In this case, it includes the ECMAScript 2021 library.
  - `module`: Specifies the module system to be used. Here, it is set to "ES2020" (ECMAScript modules).
  - `target`: Specifies the ECMAScript version to which the code will be compiled. It is set to "es2021".
  - `strict`: Enables strict type checking and stricter compiler behavior.
  - `esModuleInterop`: Enables compatibility with modules that use the CommonJS module system.
  - `skipLibCheck`: Skips type checking of declaration files (*.d.ts).
  - `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`: Enforces consistent casing of file names.
  - `moduleResolution`: Specifies how modules are resolved. Here, it is set to "node" for Node.js-style module resolution.
  - `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: Allows importing modules with a default export from modules that do not explicitly define one.
- `extends`: Specifies another configuration file to inherit settings from. In this case, it extends the "base.json" file.
- `exclude`: Specifies files or directories to be excluded from compilation. Here, it excludes the "node_modules" directory.

**Interaction Summary:**
The configuration file defines the compiler options and settings that affect how the JavaScript or TypeScript code is compiled. These options can impact the behavior, compatibility, and strictness of the compiled code. The configuration file may interact with other parts of the application, such as other configuration files, build scripts, or development tools.

**Developer Questions:**
Developers working with this code base may have the following questions when debugging or changing this configuration file:
1. What are the available options for the `lib` parameter, and how do they affect the compilation?
2. How does changing the `module` parameter to a different module system impact the application's compatibility?
3. What is the difference between the `target` and `lib` parameters?
4. What is the purpose of the `strict` parameter, and what strictness checks does it enable?
5. How does the `esModuleInterop` parameter affect the compatibility with CommonJS modules?
6. Why is the `skipLibCheck` parameter set to `true`, and what are the implications?
7. What is the significance of the `moduleResolution` parameter, and how does it affect module resolution?
8. How does the `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` parameter enable importing modules without explicit default exports?
9. What settings are defined in the "base.json" file that this configuration extends?
10. How does excluding the "node_modules" directory impact the compilation process?
