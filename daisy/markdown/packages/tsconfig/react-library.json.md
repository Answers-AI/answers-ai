Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "display": "React Library",
  "extends": "./base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "lib": ["ES2015"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "es6",
    "types": ["cypress","@types/chrome"]
  }
}
```

Summary:
This configuration file is used in a larger application, specifically a React Library. It extends a base configuration file and sets various compiler options for the TypeScript compiler.

Service:
The configuration file is specific to a React Library, which is a collection of reusable components and utilities for building user interfaces in React. It provides a set of default settings for the TypeScript compiler to ensure compatibility and optimal performance for the library.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file extends a base configuration file, indicating that it inherits settings from it. It sets the display name of the library as "React Library" and specifies the compiler options for the TypeScript compiler.

Configuration Breakdown:
- `$schema`: Specifies the JSON schema to validate the configuration file against. In this case, it uses the TypeScript configuration schema.
- `display`: Sets the display name of the library.
- `extends`: Specifies the path to the base configuration file that this file extends.
- `compilerOptions`: Contains various options for the TypeScript compiler.
  - `jsx`: Sets the JSX factory to be used by the compiler. In this case, it is set to "react-jsx".
  - `lib`: Specifies the library files to be included in the compilation. Here, it includes the ES2015 library.
  - `module`: Sets the module system to be used. It is set to "ESNext", which supports the latest ECMAScript module syntax.
  - `target`: Sets the ECMAScript target version for the compiled code. It is set to "es6".
  - `types`: Specifies the type declaration files to be included. Here, it includes "cypress" and "@types/chrome".

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file ensures that the React Library is compiled with the specified compiler options, such as the JSX factory, module system, target version, and included library and type declaration files. These settings help optimize the library's compatibility and performance.

Developer Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the `extends` property in the configuration file?
2. How can I add additional library files to be included in the compilation?
3. What is the significance of the `target` property and how does it affect the compiled code?
4. How can I add or remove type declaration files from the compilation?
5. Can I override any of the compiler options specified in the configuration file for specific files or directories?
