Summary:
This file is a React component that renders a document tree view. It imports various components from the Material-UI library and a custom buildTree function. The component receives an array of documents as a prop and builds a tree structure based on the documents. It then renders the tree using the TreeView and TreeItem components from Material-UI.

Import statements:
- React: The React library is imported to use React components and hooks.
- clsx: The clsx library is imported to conditionally apply CSS classes to the component.
- TreeView, TreeItem, TreeItemProps, useTreeItem, TreeItemContentProps: These components and types are imported from the Material-UI library to render the document tree.
- Typography, Button: These components are imported from the Material-UI library to render text and buttons.
- ExpandMoreIcon, ChevronRightIcon: These icons are imported from the Material-UI library to use as expand and collapse icons.
- buildTree: This function is imported from a local file to build the tree structure based on the provided documents.
- Document: This type is imported from a local file to define the structure of a document.

Component:
The DocumentTree component is a functional component that receives a prop named "documents" which is an array of Document objects. It uses the buildTree function to build a tree structure based on the documents. The tree structure is then rendered using the RichObjectTreeView component.

Hooks:
- useMemo: The useMemo hook is used to memoize the result of the buildTree function. It ensures that the tree is only rebuilt when the "documents" prop changes.

Event Handlers:
- handleMouseDown: This event handler prevents the default selection behavior when the mouse is pressed on the tree item.
- handleExpansionClick: This event handler is called when the expansion icon is clicked. It toggles the expansion state of the tree item.
- handleSelectionClick: This event handler is called when the label of the tree item is clicked. It selects the tree item.

Rendered components:
- CustomContent: This component is a custom content renderer for the TreeItem component. It renders the icon, label, and an "Add page" button.
- CustomTreeItem: This component is a wrapper around the TreeItem component that uses the CustomContent renderer.
- RichObjectTreeView: This component renders the tree view using the TreeView component. It recursively renders the tree structure using the CustomTreeItem component.

Interaction Summary:
The DocumentTree component receives an array of documents as a prop. It builds a tree structure based on the documents and renders it using the TreeView and TreeItem components. Users can expand and collapse tree nodes by clicking on the expand/collapse icons. They can also select a tree node by clicking on its label. The component does not handle any state itself but relies on the useTreeItem hook provided by the TreeItem component to handle expansion and selection states.

Developer Questions:
- How are the documents passed to the DocumentTree component?
- How does the buildTree function work and what is the expected structure of the documents array?
- How can I customize the appearance of the tree items?
- How can I handle events when the "Add page" button is clicked?

Known Issues / Todo:
- There are no known issues or bugs with the component.
- The "handleAdd" prop in the CustomContent component is commented out. It may need to be implemented or removed depending on the desired functionality.
