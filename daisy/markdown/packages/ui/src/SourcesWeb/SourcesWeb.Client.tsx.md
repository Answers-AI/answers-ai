The component makes HTTP requests to the server using the axios library to fetch data and sync the filter state.

Developer Questions:
- How is the filter state managed in the AnswersContext component?
- How does the Autocomplete component work and what data does it provide for URL suggestions?
- How does the useSWR hook handle data fetching and caching?
- How does the throttle function work and why is it used in the updateUrl callback?
- How are the domain cards rendered and what data is passed to them?
- How does the SourcesWeb component handle the loading and error states of the useSWR hook?

Known Issues / Todo:
- The commented out code for the DocumentTree component suggests that it was intended to be rendered, but it is currently not used. This should be addressed.
- There are no known issues or bugs with the component at the moment.
