Component:
The SlackSettings component is a functional component that receives the appSettings prop, which contains the current application settings.

- useEffect: The useEffect hook is used to update the localSettings state whenever the appSettings prop changes.

Event Handlers:
- handleSave: This event handler is triggered when the "Save" button is clicked. It calls the updateAppSettings function from the useAppSettings hook, passing the localSettings value as the updated appSettings.
