Summary:
This file exports a function called `getCachedSession` which is responsible for retrieving and caching the user session. It uses the `getServerSession` function from the `next-auth` library to fetch the session data from the server. The function can be used both on the server-side and client-side.

Import statements:
- `React` is imported from the `react` library.
- `cache` is imported from an unknown source.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` library.
- `authOptions` is imported from a local file called `authOptions`.

Interaction Summary:
This file can be imported and used in other components to retrieve the user session. It can be used both on the server-side and client-side. The `getCachedSession` function accepts optional `req` and `res` parameters, which can be used to pass the request and response objects when running on the server. If these parameters are not provided, the function will use the `authOptions` to fetch the session data.

Developer Questions:
- How should I use the `getCachedSession` function in my component?
- What are the possible values for the `req` and `res` parameters?
- How does the caching mechanism work in the `cache` function?

Known Issues / Todo:
- The source of the `cache` function is unknown, so it may have some limitations or issues that need to be investigated.
- The usage of the `authOptions` variable is not clear, and its source is also unknown. It may need to be reviewed and documented.
