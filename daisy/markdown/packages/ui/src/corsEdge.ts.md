Summary:
This code is a multi-purpose CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) library. It provides functionality to handle CORS headers and allow cross-origin requests in a web application. The code defines various types, interfaces, and functions to handle CORS headers and configure the CORS behavior. It also exports a default function `cors` and a helper function `initCors` to enable CORS in a web application.

Import statements:
- No external dependencies are imported in this code.

Script Summary:
The script defines types, interfaces, and functions related to CORS handling. It exports a default function `cors` and a helper function `initCors` to enable CORS in a web application.

Internal Functions:
1. `isOriginAllowed(origin: string, allowed: StaticOrigin): boolean`: This function checks if a given origin is allowed based on the allowed origin configuration. It recursively checks if the origin matches any of the allowed origins specified as a string, regular expression, or an array of allowed origins.

2. `getOriginHeaders(reqOrigin: string | undefined, origin: StaticOrigin): Headers`: This function returns the CORS headers based on the requested origin and the allowed origin configuration. It sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header based on the allowed origin. If the allowed origin is "*", it allows any origin. If the allowed origin is a string, it sets the header to that origin. If the allowed origin is a function, it checks if the requested origin is allowed and sets the header accordingly. It also appends the "Vary" header to indicate that the response varies based on the origin.

3. `originHeadersFromReq(req: Request, origin: StaticOrigin | OriginFn): Promise<Headers | undefined>`: This async function returns the CORS headers based on the request and the allowed origin configuration. It first retrieves the requested origin from the request headers. If the allowed origin is a function, it calls the function with the requested origin and the request object to get the allowed origin. It then calls the `getOriginHeaders` function to get the CORS headers based on the allowed origin. If the allowed origin is not defined or if the headers cannot be obtained, it returns undefined.

4. `getAllowedHeaders(req: Request, allowed?: string | string[]): Headers`: This function returns the allowed headers based on the request and the allowed headers configuration. If the allowed headers are not defined, it retrieves the headers from the request headers. If the allowed headers are an array, it converts them to a comma-separated string. It then sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header with the allowed headers and appends the "Vary" header to indicate that the response varies based on the requested headers.

External Functions:
1. `cors(req: Request, res: Response, options?: CorsOptions): Promise<Response>`: This default exported function handles CORS for a given request and response. It takes the request object, response object, and optional CORS options as parameters. It merges the default options with the provided options. It calls the `originHeadersFromReq` function to get the CORS headers based on the request and the allowed origin configuration. If the headers are obtained, it merges them with the response headers. If the `credentials` option is enabled, it sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to "true". If the `exposedHeaders` option is defined, it sets the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header with the exposed headers. If the request method is "OPTIONS" (preflight request), it sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header with the allowed methods, sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header with the allowed headers, sets the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header with the max age, and returns a response with the appropriate status and headers. If it's a normal request, it returns the response object.

2. `initCors(options?: CorsOptions): (req: Request, res: Response) => Promise<Response>`: This function returns a middleware function that enables CORS for a given request and response. It takes the CORS options as an optional parameter. It returns a function that calls the `cors` function with the request, response, and options.

Interaction Summary:
This code can be used as a middleware in a web application to enable CORS. It can be imported and used in other parts of the application to handle cross-origin requests and set the necessary CORS headers.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I configure the allowed origins, methods, headers, and other CORS options?
2. How can I use this code as a middleware in my web application?
3. How can I handle preflight requests and set the appropriate headers?
4. How can I customize the CORS behavior based on the request origin?
5. How can I enable CORS with credentials (cookies, authorization headers, etc.)?
6. How can I expose additional headers in the CORS response?
7. How can I set the maximum age for preflight requests?
8. Are there any potential bugs or issues in this code?
