Component:
The JiraSettings component is a functional component that receives props appSettings and editable. It renders a form that allows users to configure Jira integration settings. The form includes checkboxes to enable/disable Jira projects, autocomplete selects for default filters, and buttons to save or discard changes.

Hooks:
- useState: The component uses the useState hook to manage state for filters and localSettings. The filters state represents the selected default filters, while the localSettings state represents the current settings being edited.
- useEffect: The component uses the useEffect hook to update the localSettings state when the appSettings prop changes.

Event Handlers:
- handleSave: This event handler is called when the user clicks the save button. It updates the appSettings by calling the updateAppSettings function with the updated localSettings and filters.
- handleEnableProject: This event handler is called when the user toggles the enable/disable checkbox for a specific Jira project. It updates the localSettings by toggling the enabled property of the corresponding project.
- handleToggleAll: This event handler is called when the user clicks the select/deselect all button. It updates the localSettings by toggling the enabled property of all Jira projects.

Rendered components:
