Known Issues / Todo:
- The test cases for handling likes, dislikes, rendering developer_mode when enabled, and not rendering developer_mode when disabled are commented out. These test cases need to be implemented.
- The createdAt, updatedAt, emailVerified, invited, and image properties of the user object in defaultProps are not properly initialized. They need to be assigned valid values.
- The accounts and appSettings properties of the user object in defaultProps are commented out. It is unclear why they are commented out and whether they should be included in the defaultProps. This needs clarification.
