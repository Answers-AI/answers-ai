Component:
The MessageCard component is a functional component that renders a message card. It takes several props, including id, content, role, user, error, prompt, extra, pineconeData, filteredData, unfilteredData, context, summary, completionData, completionRequest, filters, likes, dislikes, isWidget, and contextDocuments. The component also uses the useFlags and useAnswers hooks to access feature flags and data from the AnswersContext.

Hooks:
- useState: The component uses the useState hook to manage the state of lastInteraction and codeStyle.

Event Handlers:
- handleLike: This event handler is called when the user clicks the like button. It updates the lastInteraction state to 'like' and calls the updateMessage function from the useAnswers hook to update the likes count of the message.
- handleCopyCodeClick: This event handler is called when the user clicks the copy code button. It uses the navigator.clipboard API to copy the code string to the clipboard.
- handleDislike: This event handler is called when the user clicks the dislike button. It updates the lastInteraction state to 'dislike' and calls the updateMessage function from the useAnswers hook to update the dislikes count of the message.

Rendered components:
- Avatar: Displays the user's avatar or a default avatar image.
- Box: Provides a container for the card content and actions.
- Button: Renders buttons for displaying references to context documents.

Interaction Summary:
The MessageCard component interacts with other components in the application through the useAnswers hook. It accesses user data, app settings, and provides functions for updating messages. It also uses the useFlags hook to access feature flags. The component renders sub-components such as Avatar, Button, Card, and Typography to display the message content and additional information. It also uses the Accordion component to create collapsible sections for context, error details, and other extra information.

Developer Questions:
- How can I customize the appearance of the message card?
- How can I add additional sections or information to the message card?
- How does the useAnswers hook work and what data does it provide?
- How can I handle errors and display error details in the message card?
- How can I access and use feature flags from the Flagsmith service?
- How can I customize the syntax highlighting style for code examples?
- How can I add or modify the functionality of the like and dislike buttons?
- How can I handle user interactions with the message card, such as copying code or expanding/collapsing sections?

Known Issues / Todo:
- The codeStyle state is not currently used and can be removed.
- The useEffect hook for importing the code highlighting style is commented out and can be removed if not needed.
- The component could benefit from better error handling and error message display.
- The component could be optimized for performance by memoizing certain values or using React.memo for rendering.
- The component could be made more reusable by allowing customization of the rendered sub-components and their appearance.
