Summary:
This code is a script that sets up and exports a middleware function for handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in a Next.js API route. The purpose of this script is to allow requests from different origins (domains) to access the API route. It plays a role in the broader software application by ensuring that the API route can be accessed by clients from different domains.

Import statements:
- `Cors` is imported from the 'cors' package. This package provides middleware for handling CORS in Node.js applications.
- `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` are imported from the 'next' package. These types are used to define the request and response objects in Next.js API routes.

Script Summary:
The script defines a helper function called `initMiddleware` that takes a middleware function as a parameter. This function wraps the middleware function and returns a new function that can be used as middleware in Next.js API routes. The purpose of this function is to handle errors that may occur in the middleware and ensure that the middleware is executed before continuing.

The script then initializes the CORS middleware by calling the `initMiddleware` function with the `Cors` middleware function as a parameter. The CORS middleware is configured to only allow requests with the HTTP methods GET, POST, and OPTIONS.

Finally, the script exports the initialized CORS middleware as the default export.

Internal Functions:
- `initMiddleware`: This function takes a middleware function as a parameter and returns a new function that can be used as middleware in Next.js API routes. It wraps the middleware function and handles errors that may occur in the middleware. It takes the `req` (NextApiRequest) and `res` (NextApiResponse) objects as parameters and returns a Promise. Inside the Promise, the middleware function is called with the `req`, `res`, and a callback function as parameters. If the callback function is called with an instance of `Error`, the Promise is rejected with the error. Otherwise, the Promise is resolved with the result of the middleware function.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used in a Next.js API route by importing and using the exported middleware function. The middleware function should be added as middleware to the API route using the `use` method provided by Next.js.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use this middleware in a Next.js API route?
- Can I configure the CORS middleware to allow additional HTTP methods?
- What happens if an error occurs in the middleware?
