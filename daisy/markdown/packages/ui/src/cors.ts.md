Summary:
This code is a script that sets up and exports a middleware function for handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in a Next.js API route. The purpose of this script is to allow requests from different origins (domains) to access the API route. It plays a role in the broader software application by ensuring that the API route can be accessed by clients from different domains.

Import statements:
- `Cors` is imported from the 'cors' module. This module provides middleware for handling CORS in Express.js applications.
- `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` are imported from the 'next' module. These types define the request and response objects for Next.js API routes.

Script Summary:
The script defines a helper function called `initMiddleware` that takes a middleware function as a parameter. This function returns a new function that wraps the provided middleware function. The returned function takes the request and response objects as parameters and returns a Promise. This Promise resolves when the provided middleware function is executed, and rejects with an error if an error occurs in the middleware.

The script then initializes the CORS middleware by calling `initMiddleware` with the `Cors` middleware function as the parameter. The CORS middleware is configured to only allow requests with the HTTP methods GET, POST, and OPTIONS.

Finally, the script exports the initialized CORS middleware function as the default export.

Internal Functions:
- `initMiddleware`: This function takes a middleware function as a parameter and returns a new function that wraps the provided middleware function. The returned function takes the request and response objects as parameters and returns a Promise. This Promise resolves when the provided middleware function is executed, and rejects with an error if an error occurs in the middleware.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used in a Next.js API route by importing and using the exported middleware function. The middleware function should be added as a middleware to the API route to handle CORS.

Developer Questions:
- How do I configure the CORS middleware to allow requests from specific origins?
- Can I add additional middleware functions to the CORS middleware?
- How do I handle errors that occur in the middleware?
