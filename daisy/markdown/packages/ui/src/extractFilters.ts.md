Summary:
This code is a JavaScript function that extracts filters from a prompt using the OpenAI API. The function takes a prompt string and an object of filters as input and returns the filters after processing them with the OpenAI model. The purpose of this script is to automate the extraction of filters from a given prompt using AI.

Import statements:
- `AnswersFilters` is imported from the 'types' module. It is likely a custom type or interface used to define the structure of the filters object.
- `openai` is imported from the '@utils/openai/client' module. It is a utility function or object that provides access to the OpenAI API.

Script Summary:
The script defines an asynchronous function named `extractFilters` that takes a prompt string and a filters object as input. It makes an API call to the OpenAI model to process the prompt and extract the filters. The extracted filters are then returned.

Internal Functions:
- `extractFilters`: This function takes a prompt string and a filters object as input. It makes an API call to the OpenAI model to process the prompt and extract the filters. The extracted filters are then returned.

External Functions:
None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the OpenAI API to process the prompt and extract the filters. It may be used as a part of a larger application that requires automated extraction of filters from user prompts.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the OpenAI model used for processing the prompt?
- What happens if the API response does not contain any filters?
- How can I handle errors that occur during the parsing of filters?
- Can I customize the temperature, max_tokens, frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty values used in the API call?
- How can I test this function with different prompts and filters?
