Summary:
This code is a JavaScript module that contains a single function called `extractFilters`. The function takes a prompt string and an object of filters as parameters and returns the filters after processing them using an AI model. The purpose of this script is to extract filters from a given prompt using an AI model and return them as a valid JSON object.

Import statements:
- `AnswersFilters` is imported from the `types` module. It is likely a custom type or interface used to define the structure of the filters object.
- `openai` is imported from the `@utils/openai/client` module. It is a utility function or object that provides access to the OpenAI API.

Script Summary:
The script defines a single asynchronous function called `extractFilters`. This function takes a prompt string and a filters object as parameters. It makes an API call to the OpenAI API to process the prompt and extract the filters. The extracted filters are then returned.

Internal Functions:
- `extractFilters`: This is the main function of the script. It takes a prompt string and a filters object as parameters. It makes an API call to the OpenAI API using the `openai.createCompletion` function. The API call includes the prompt, model, and various parameters for controlling the response. The function then processes the API response to extract the filters and returns them.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the OpenAI API to process the prompt and extract the filters. It may be used as a part of a larger application that requires extracting filters from user input.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the AI model used for processing the prompt?
- What happens if the API response does not contain any filters?
- How can I handle errors that occur during the parsing of the filters?
- Can I customize the parameters used for the API call?
