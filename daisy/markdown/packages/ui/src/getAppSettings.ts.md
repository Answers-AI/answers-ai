Summary:
This code is a module that exports a function called `getAppSettings`. The purpose of this function is to retrieve the application settings. It takes an optional `req` and `res` parameters, which are used to retrieve a cached session. If a session exists and has a user, it returns the user's app settings. Otherwise, it returns the system settings.

Import statements:
- `SYSTEM_SETTINGS` is imported from the `@utils/auth/SYSTEM_SETTINGS` module. This is likely a constant that contains the system settings.
- `AppSettings` is imported from the `types` module. This is likely a type definition for the application settings.
- `getCachedSession` is imported from the local `getCachedSession` module. This function is used to retrieve a cached session.

Script Summary:
The `getAppSettings` function is defined as an async function that returns a Promise of type `AppSettings`. It takes an optional `req` and `res` parameters, which are used to retrieve a cached session. If the session exists and has a user, it returns the user's app settings. Otherwise, it returns the system settings.

Internal Functions:
- `getAppSettings`: This is the main function of the script. It takes an optional `req` and `res` parameters. It first calls the `getCachedSession` function to retrieve the session. If the session exists and has a user, it returns the user's app settings. Otherwise, it returns the system settings.

External Functions:
- `getCachedSession`: This function is imported from the local `getCachedSession` module. It takes an optional `req` and `res` parameters and returns a Promise of the session.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the `getCachedSession` module to retrieve the session. It also depends on the `SYSTEM_SETTINGS` constant and the `AppSettings` type definition.

Developer Questions:
- What is the structure of the `SYSTEM_SETTINGS` constant?
- What is the structure of the `AppSettings` type?
- How is the session cached and retrieved in the `getCachedSession` module?
- What happens if the `getCachedSession` function throws an error?
- How is this script used in the broader application?
