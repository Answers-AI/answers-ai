Component:
The ShareModal component is a functional component that represents a modal for sharing a chat. It takes in props such as title, onSave, onClose, and source. It uses the useState hook to manage the open and loading state of the modal. It also uses the useRouter hook to handle routing and the useAnswers hook to access the chat data.

Hooks:
- useState: manages the open and loading state of the modal.
- useRouter: handles routing within the application.
- useAnswers: provides access to the chat data.

Event Handlers:
- handleOpen: sets the open state to true, opening the modal.
- handleClose: sets the open state to false, closing the modal. If an onClose prop is provided, it is called before closing the modal.
- onSubmit: handles form submission. It makes a POST request to the "/api/chats/{chatId}/share" endpoint with the entered email addresses and updates the chat data. If an error occurs, it sets an error message for the email field.
- onDelete: handles deletion of a user. It makes a PATCH request to the "/api/chats/share" endpoint with the chatId and updated list of email addresses. It then refreshes the router. If an error occurs, it sets an error message for the email field.
