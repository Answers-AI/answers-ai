Component:
The ShareModal component is a functional component that represents a modal for sharing a chat. It takes in props such as title, onSave, onClose, and source.

- useRouter: handles routing within the application.
- useAnswers: provides access to the chat data.

Event Handlers:

- handleClose: sets the open state to false, closing the modal. If an onClose prop is provided, it is called before closing the modal.
- onSubmit: handles form submission. It makes a POST request to the "/api/chats/{chatId}/share" endpoint with the entered email addresses and updates the chat data. If an error occurs, it sets an error message for the email field.
- onDelete: handles deletion of a user. It makes a PATCH request to the "/api/chats/share" endpoint with the chatId and updated list of email addresses. It then updates the chat data.
