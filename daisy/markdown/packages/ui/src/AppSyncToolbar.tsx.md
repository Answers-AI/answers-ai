Component:
The AppSyncToolbar component is a functional component that represents the sync toolbar. It accepts props for controlling the expanded state, app settings, and a callback for sync events. It uses the useFlags hook to access feature flags and the useSync hook to handle sync events.

Hooks:
- useSync: A custom hook that takes an optional onSync callback and returns a handleSync function. The handleSync function makes an HTTP POST request to the '/api/sync/{serviceName}' endpoint with the filters data from the useAnswers hook. If the request is successful, it calls the onSync callback with the serviceName parameter.

Event Handlers:
- handleSync: An async function that takes a serviceName parameter and makes an HTTP POST request to the '/api/sync/{serviceName}' endpoint with the filters data from the useAnswers hook. If the request is successful, it calls the onSync callback with the serviceName parameter.

Rendered components:
- Accordion: Represents the main container for the sync toolbar. It has a defaultExpanded prop for controlling the initial expanded state.
- AccordionSummary: Represents the header of the accordion. It displays the "Sync" text and an expand icon.
- AccordionDetails: Represents the content of the accordion. It contains a Box component for displaying the sync buttons.
- Box: A container component for displaying the sync buttons. It uses the display, gap, and flexWrap props to control the layout.
- Button: Represents a sync button. It has a variant prop set to "outlined", a color prop set to "primary", and an onClick event handler that calls the handleSync function with the corresponding service name.
- Typography: Represents the "Sync" text in the AccordionSummary component.
- ExpandMoreIcon: Represents the expand icon in the AccordionSummary component.

Interaction Summary:
The AppSyncToolbar component interacts with other components in the application through props. It receives the expanded state, app settings, and a callback for sync events. It uses the useAnswers hook to access answers data and the useFlags hook to access feature flags. When a sync button is clicked, it calls the handleSync function with the corresponding service name, which makes an HTTP POST request to the server. If the request is successful, it calls the onSync callback with the service name.
