Summary:
The provided React file is a client-side component called "AccessDenied". It is responsible for rendering a page that displays an "Access Denied" message and a link to sign in if the user is not authenticated.

Import statements:
The file imports the "signIn" function from the "next-auth/react" module.

Component:
The "AccessDenied" component is a functional component that returns JSX elements. It renders a heading with the text "Access Denied" and a paragraph containing a link. The link triggers the "signIn" function when clicked, preventing the default behavior and redirecting the user to the sign-in page.

Hooks:
None.

Event Handlers:
The component has an onClick event handler attached to the link. When the link is clicked, the event handler prevents the default behavior (navigating to the href) and calls the "signIn" function.

Rendered components:
The component renders a heading element (<h1>) with the text "Access Denied" and a paragraph element (<p>) containing an anchor element (<a>). The anchor element has an href attribute set to "/api/auth/signin" and an onClick event handler.

Interaction Summary:
