Component:
The GptModelSelect component is a functional component that renders a select menu with options for selecting different GPT models. It receives two props: onGptModelSelected and selectedGptModel. The onGptModelSelected prop is a callback function that will be called when a GPT model is selected. The selectedGptModel prop is a string representing the currently selected GPT model.

Hooks:
None.

Event Handlers:
- handleGptModelChange: This event handler function is called when the select menu value changes. It receives a SelectChangeEvent object as its argument, which contains the new value of the select menu. It calls the onGptModelSelected prop callback function with the new value as its argument.
