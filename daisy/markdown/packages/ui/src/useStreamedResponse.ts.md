Summary:
The purpose of this script is to provide a custom hook called `useStreamedResponse` that handles the generation of AI responses in a streaming manner. It makes use of the `useState` hook from the React library to manage state. The script also includes a helper function called `parseMessages` that parses an array of messages and returns a new array with only the `role` and `content` properties.

Import statements:
- `useState` from 'react': This import is used to import the `useState` hook from the React library. It is used to manage state within functional components.
- `Message` and `Sidekick` from 'types': These imports are used to import the `Message` and `Sidekick` types from a module called 'types'. These types are likely used within the script to define the shape of certain variables.

Script Summary:
The script defines a custom hook called `useStreamedResponse` that takes in an object with three properties: `apiUrl`, `onChunk`, and `onEnd`. It returns an object with three properties: `isStreaming`, `generatedResponse`, and `generateResponse`. The `isStreaming` property is a boolean value that indicates whether the streaming process is currently active. The `generatedResponse` property is an object that stores the generated response from the AI. The `generateResponse` function is an asynchronous function that sends a request to an API endpoint to generate an AI response. It uses the `fetch` function to make a POST request and handles the response in a streaming manner. The response is read in chunks and processed until the streaming is complete. The `onChunk` and `onEnd` functions are called to handle each chunk of the response and the end of the streaming process, respectively.

Internal Functions:
- `parseMessages`: This function takes in an optional array of messages and returns a new array with only the `role` and `content` properties of each message. It is used to parse the `messages` array before sending it in the API request.

External Functions:
- `useStreamedResponse`: This function is the main function of the script and serves as a custom hook. It takes in an object with three properties: `apiUrl`, `onChunk`, and `onEnd`. It returns an object with three properties: `isStreaming`, `generatedResponse`, and `generateResponse`. The `isStreaming` property is a boolean value that indicates whether the streaming process is currently active. The `generatedResponse` property is an object that stores the generated response from the AI. The `generateResponse` function is an asynchronous function that sends a request to an API endpoint to generate an AI response. It uses the `fetch` function to make a POST request and handles the response in a streaming manner. The response is read in chunks and processed until the streaming is complete. The `onChunk` and `onEnd` functions are called to handle each chunk of the response and the end of the streaming process, respectively.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a custom hook in a React application to handle the generation of AI responses in a streaming manner. It can be integrated with other components or hooks to provide real-time AI responses to the user.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the API endpoint URL?
- How can I handle errors during the streaming process?
- How can I customize the behavior of the `onChunk` and `onEnd` functions?
- How can I pass additional parameters to the API request?
- How can I handle the response data in a different format?
