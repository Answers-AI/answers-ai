Summary:
This code is a TypeScript module that exports a custom React hook called `useStreamedResponse`. The hook is used to handle streaming responses from an API endpoint. It takes in an API URL, callback functions for handling chunks of data and the end of the response, and returns state variables and a function for generating a response.

Import statements:
- `useState` from 'react': This import is used to define and update state variables in a React component.
- `Message` and `Sidekick` from 'types': These imports are used to define the types of the `Message` and `Sidekick` objects used in the code.

Script Summary:
This script exports a custom React hook called `useStreamedResponse`. The hook is used to handle streaming responses from an API endpoint. It takes in an API URL, callback functions for handling chunks of data and the end of the response, and returns state variables and a function for generating a response.

Internal Functions:
- `parseMessages`: This function takes an array of message objects and returns a new array with only the `role` and `content` properties of each message object.

External Functions:
- `useStreamedResponse`: This function is a custom React hook that takes in an object with an API URL, callback functions for handling chunks of data and the end of the response. It returns state variables and a function for generating a response. The function uses the `useState` hook to define and update state variables for `isStreaming` and `generatedResponse`. It also defines an async function called `generateResponse` that takes in various arguments for generating a response. Inside the `generateResponse` function, an API request is made using the `fetch` function. If the response is not successful, an error is thrown. The response data is then read as a stream and decoded using a `TextDecoder`. The data is read in chunks and concatenated until the stream is done. The concatenated data is split into JSON and non-JSON parts. The JSON part is parsed and used to update the `extra` variable, while the non-JSON part is used as the content of the response chunk. The `onChunk` callback function is called with the response chunk and the `extra` variable. Finally, the state variables are reset and the `onEnd` callback function is called with the final response chunk and the `extra` variable.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as a custom React hook in a larger application to handle streaming responses from an API endpoint. It provides state variables and a function for generating a response. The `onChunk` and `onEnd` callback functions can be used to handle the received chunks of data and the end of the response, respectively.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use this hook in my React component?
- What are the required callback functions for handling the response chunks and the end of the response?
- How can I customize the API URL used in the `fetch` request?
- What are the available options for the `filters`, `sidekick`, and `gptModel` arguments in the `generateResponse` function?
- How can I handle errors that occur during the API request or response handling?
