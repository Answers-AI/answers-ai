## Import statements:
- `React` and various hooks from `react` library
- `axios` for making HTTP requests
- `useRouter` from `next/navigation` for handling routing
- `useSWR` for data fetching and caching
- `deepmerge` from `@utils/deepmerge` for merging objects

- `AnswersFilters`, `AppSettings`, `Chat`, `Journey`, `Message`, `Prompt`, `Sidekick`, and `User` from `types` for defining types

## Component:
The main component in this file is `AnswersProvider`. It is a context provider component that wraps its children with an `AnswersContext.Provider`. It takes various props including `chat`, `journey`, `user`, `appSettings`, `prompts`, `useStreaming`, and `apiUrl`. It also uses the `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation` for handling routing.

## Hooks:
- `useAnswers`: This hook is used to consume the `AnswersContext` and return its context value.

## Event Handlers:
- `sendMessage`: This event handler is used to send a message. It takes an object with `content`, `sidekick`, `gptModel`, and `retry` properties. It makes an HTTP request to the server to generate a response based on the provided message content and other parameters.
- `clearMessages`: This event handler is used to clear the messages and reset the chat state.
- `regenerateAnswer`: This event handler is used to regenerate the answer based on the last user message. It takes an optional `retry` parameter to indicate whether it is a retry attempt.
- `deleteChat`: This event handler is used to delete a chat. It takes the chat ID as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to the server to delete the chat.
- `deletePrompt`: This event handler is used to delete a prompt. It takes the prompt ID as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to the server to delete the prompt.
- `deleteJourney`: This event handler is used to delete a journey. It takes the journey ID as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to the server to delete the journey.
- `updateChat`: This event handler is used to update a chat. It takes a partial chat object as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to the server to update the chat.
- `updatePrompt`: This event handler is used to update a prompt. It takes a partial prompt object as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to the server to update the prompt.
- `upsertJourney`: This event handler is used to upsert a journey. It takes a partial journey object as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to the server to upsert the journey.
- `updateMessage`: This event handler is used to update a message. It takes a partial message object as a parameter and makes an HTTP request to the server to update the message.
- `startNewChat`: This event handler is used to start a new chat. It clears the chat state and navigates to the chat page.

## Interaction Summary:
This file provides a context for managing answers in a larger application. It handles user interactions such as sending messages, clearing messages, regenerating answers, and managing chat, journey, and filter settings. It also provides various event handlers for updating and deleting chats, prompts, journeys, and messages. The component interacts with other components through the `AnswersContext` and uses the `useRouter` hook for handling routing.

## Developer Questions:
- How can I access the answers context in other components?
- How does the `useAnswers` hook work?
- How are messages and chat state managed in this component?
- How does the streaming response handling work?
- How are filters and app settings merged in this component?

## Known Issues / Todo:
- Polling is not currently enabled for shared chats.
- Refreshing the router after deleting a chat, prompt, or journey may not work as expected.
