Developer Questions:
- How can I customize the appearance of the menu items?

- How can I handle navigation to different pages when a menu item is clicked?
- How can I access the user session data in other components?
- How can I add additional feature flags and use them in the component?

Known Issues / Todo:
- The DrawerHeader component is currently commented out. It should be uncommented and implemented to display the application logo.
- The useFlags hook is currently used with a hardcoded flag key 'settings'. It should be updated to use dynamic flag keys.
- The usePathname hook is currently used with a hardcoded value of '/' for the home menu item. It should be updated to use the actual home page pathname.
- The Drawer component has some styling issues on smaller screens. It should be updated to handle responsive behavior properly.
