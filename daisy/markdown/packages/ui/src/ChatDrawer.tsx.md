- How does the component handle the expanded state of individual journeys?
- How does the component handle adding new chats?
- How does the component handle navigation to different pages?

Known Issues / Todo:
- The code contains commented out code that may need to be removed.
- The component does not currently handle the initial open state of the drawer using local storage.
