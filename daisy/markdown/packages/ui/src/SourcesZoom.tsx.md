Hooks:

- useSWR: This hook fetches data from the specified URL and provides the fetched data and a mutate function for updating the data.

Event Handlers:
- onChange: This event handler is triggered when the value of the Autocomplete component changes. It updates the filter for the "zoom" source in the answers.
