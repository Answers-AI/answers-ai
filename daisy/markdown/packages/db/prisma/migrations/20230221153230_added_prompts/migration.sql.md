The purpose of this code is to create a database table called "Prompt" and add a foreign key constraint to it. This script is likely part of a larger software application that involves managing prompts and their associated users.

The structure of the script is a SQL script written in a string format. It consists of two parts: the creation of the "Prompt" table and the addition of a foreign key constraint.

The import statements are not applicable in this case as the code is written in SQL and does not require any external libraries or modules.

There are no classes or functions in this code. It is a simple SQL script that creates a table and adds a foreign key constraint.

The script does not contain any loops or conditional statements. It is a straightforward set of SQL commands.

The variable usage in this code is limited to the table and column names. These variables are used to define the structure of the "Prompt" table and the foreign key constraint.

There are no known issues or bugs with this code. However, it is important to ensure that the referenced table "User" and its column "id" exist before running this script. Otherwise, it will result in an error. Additionally, it is recommended to validate the data types and constraints of the columns to ensure they align with the application's requirements.

In summary, this code creates a database table called "Prompt" and adds a foreign key constraint to it. It is a simple SQL script that can be executed to set up the necessary database structure for the application.
