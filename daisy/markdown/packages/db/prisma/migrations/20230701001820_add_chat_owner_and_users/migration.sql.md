Script Purpose and Role:
The given code snippet is a SQL script that performs two operations on a database table named "Chat". The first operation is to add a new column called "ownerId" to the "Chat" table. The second operation is to add a foreign key constraint to the "ownerId" column, referencing the "id" column of the "User" table. This foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity between the "Chat" and "User" tables.

Script Structure:
The script consists of two SQL statements, each separated by a line break and enclosed within triple quotes ("""). The first statement is an ALTER TABLE statement to add a new column, and the second statement is another ALTER TABLE statement to add a foreign key constraint.

Import Statements:
There are no import statements in this script.

Classes and Functions:
There are no classes or functions defined in this script. It only contains SQL statements.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
There are no loops or conditional statements in this script. It directly executes the two SQL statements.

Variable Usage:
There are no variables used in this script. The SQL statements directly reference the table and column names.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
1. Missing semicolon: Both SQL statements lack a semicolon (;) at the end. Although some database systems may allow omitting the semicolon, it is considered good practice to include it to avoid any potential issues.

Suggested Solution:
Add a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement, like this:

"""
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Chat" ADD COLUMN "ownerId" TEXT;

-- AddForeignKey
ALTER TABLE "Chat" ADD CONSTRAINT "Chat_ownerId_fkey" FOREIGN KEY ("ownerId") REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;
"""

Summary:
The given code snippet is a SQL script that adds a new column to the "Chat" table and creates a foreign key constraint on that column. It is a standalone script that can be executed on a database to modify the table structure. The script should be modified to include semicolons at the end of each SQL statement for better compatibility with different database systems.
