Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to create a database table called "Answer" and add a foreign key constraint to it. This script is likely part of a larger software application that involves managing prompts and their corresponding answers.

Script Structure:
The script is written in SQL and consists of two parts. The first part is the creation of the "Answer" table, and the second part is the addition of a foreign key constraint to the "promptId" column of the "Answer" table.

Import Statements:

Variable Usage:
There are no variables used in this script. The script directly uses the table and column names in the SQL statements.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
There are no apparent bugs or issues in this script. However, it is important to ensure that the referenced table "Prompt" and its column "id" exist before executing this script. Otherwise, the foreign key constraint will fail.

Suggested Solutions:
To address the potential issue mentioned above, it is recommended to execute this script after creating the "Prompt" table and ensuring that it has an "id" column.

Summary:
This script creates a database table called "Answer" and adds a foreign key constraint to the "promptId" column. It is a simple SQL script that is part of a larger software application. The script does not have any import statements, classes, or functions. There are no loops or conditional statements, and the script directly uses the table and column names in the SQL statements.
