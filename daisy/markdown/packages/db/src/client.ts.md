Summary:
This code is a script that configures and extends the functionality of the PrismaClient from the '../generated/prisma-client' module. It modifies the behavior of certain Prisma queries to implement soft deletion for specific models. Soft deletion means that instead of permanently deleting records from the database, they are marked as deleted by setting a 'deleted' flag to true. The script also sets up logging levels for the PrismaClient based on the DEBUG_LEVEL environment variable.

Import statements:
- { PrismaClient } from '../generated/prisma-client': This imports the PrismaClient class from the '../generated/prisma-client' module.

Script Summary:
The script configures the PrismaClient instance by modifying its behavior for soft deletion and setting up logging levels. It also exports the configured PrismaClient instance.

Internal Functions:
- prisma.$use: This function is a middleware that intercepts and modifies Prisma queries. It takes two parameters: params and next. The params parameter contains information about the current query, such as the model, action, and arguments. The next parameter is a function that should be called to continue the execution of the query. The function modifies the behavior of findUnique, findFirst, findMany, delete, and deleteMany actions for the specified soft delete models. It changes the action to findFirst for findUnique and findFirst actions, adds a 'deleted' filter to exclude deleted records, and changes delete and deleteMany actions to update and updateMany actions respectively, setting the 'deleted' flag to true.

External Functions:
- prisma: This is the configured PrismaClient instance that is exported from the script.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the PrismaClient module and modifies its behavior for soft deletion. It can be used by other parts of the application to perform database operations using the configured PrismaClient instance.

Developer Questions:
- How can I configure the logging levels for the PrismaClient?
- How can I add soft deletion behavior to other models?
- How can I disable soft deletion for specific models?
- How can I restrict updating "soft deleted" records?
- How can I modify the behavior of other Prisma actions?
