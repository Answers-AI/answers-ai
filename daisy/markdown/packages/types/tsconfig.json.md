Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2015"],
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "extends": "tsconfig/base.json",
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

Summary:
The provided file is a configuration file for a larger application. It specifies various settings and options that affect the behavior of the application's TypeScript compiler. It also includes information about which files to include or exclude during the compilation process.

Service:
The configuration file is specific to the TypeScript compiler, which is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to enhance the development experience.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file overrides the default settings of the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the following options:
- "lib": Specifies the libraries to include when compiling the code. In this case, it includes the ES2015 library.
- "module": Specifies the module system to use. Here, it is set to "CommonJS", which is a widely used module system in Node.js and other JavaScript environments.
- "outDir": Specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files. In this case, it is set to "./dist", indicating that the compiled files should be placed in a directory named "dist" in the project's root.
- "rootDir": Specifies the root directory of the TypeScript source files. Here, it is set to "./src", indicating that the source files are located in a directory named "src" in the project's root.
- "sourceMap": Specifies whether to generate source maps for the compiled JavaScript files. Source maps allow developers to debug the original TypeScript code in the browser's developer tools.

The configuration file also includes the following properties:
- "exclude": Specifies the files or directories to exclude from the compilation process. In this case, it excludes the "node_modules" directory, which typically contains third-party libraries.
- "extends": Specifies another configuration file to extend. Here, it extends a base configuration file named "tsconfig/base.json". This allows for modular and reusable configuration settings.
- "include": Specifies the files or directories to include in the compilation process. In this case, it includes the "src" directory, indicating that all files within that directory should be compiled.

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler by providing it with specific settings and options. These settings affect how the compiler transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript code. The specified options determine the behavior of the compiler, such as the module system to use, the output directory for compiled files, and whether to generate source maps.

Developer Questions:
Developers working with this code base may have the following questions when debugging or changing this file:
1. What other configuration files can be extended using the "extends" property?
2. How can I add additional libraries to the "lib" property?
3. How can I change the output directory for compiled files?
4. How can I include or exclude specific files or directories from the compilation process?
5. How can I disable source map generation?
6. What other compiler options are available and how do they affect the compilation process?
