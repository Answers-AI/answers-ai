Summary:
This code file contains a collection of interfaces and types that define the structure and data models used in a software application. It also includes some import statements for external dependencies.

Import statements:
- `import * as DB from 'db/generated/prisma-client';`: This imports all the exported members from the 'db/generated/prisma-client' module and assigns them to the `DB` namespace.
- `import { Hit } from '@algolia/client-search';`: This imports the `Hit` type from the '@algolia/client-search' module.

Script Summary:
This script defines a large number of interfaces and types that represent various data structures used in the application. These interfaces and types are used to define the structure of objects and data that are used throughout the application.

Internal Functions:
There are no internal functions defined in this script.

External Functions:
There are no external functions defined in this script.

Interaction Summary:
This script does not have any direct interaction with the rest of the application. It provides a set of interfaces and types that can be used by other parts of the application to define and manipulate data structures.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use these interfaces and types in my code?
- Are there any additional interfaces or types that need to be defined for specific use cases?
- How can I extend or modify these interfaces and types to fit my application's needs?
- Are there any known issues or bugs with the data models defined in this script?
- Are there any additional dependencies or modules that need to be imported to use these interfaces and types?
