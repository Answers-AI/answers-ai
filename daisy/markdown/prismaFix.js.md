Summary:
This script is responsible for creating directories and copying files to specific paths. It also pings a list of URLs to check their response status codes and log the response data. The script uses the fs, path, util, and http modules for file system operations, path manipulation, promise-based utilities, and HTTP requests, respectively.

Import statements:
- fs: This module provides an API for interacting with the file system.
- path: This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- util: This module provides utility functions for working with promises and other asynchronous operations.
- http: This module provides functionality for making HTTP requests.

Script Summary:
The script defines an array of paths and an array of URLs. It then defines two empty arrays and two variables to store file paths. The script contains an async function called processPaths, which iterates over the paths array and checks if each path exists. If a path does not exist, it creates the directory using the mkdir function from the fs module. It also checks if a specific file exists in each path and stores the file path in the corresponding variable or adds the path to the corresponding missing files array. After processing the paths, the script checks if the SOURCE_FILE_DARWIN variable is set and if so, it iterates over the missing Darwin files array and copies the source file to each destination path using the copyFile function from the fs module. The script then repeats the same process for the SOURCE_FILE_PRISMASCHEMA variable and the missing Prisma schema files array. Finally, the script calls the processPaths function and the pingPaths function, passing the URLs array as an argument.

Internal Functions:
- processPaths: This async function iterates over the PATHS array and checks if each path exists. If a path does not exist, it creates the directory using the mkdir function from the fs module. It also checks if a specific file exists in each path and stores the file path in the corresponding variable or adds the path to the corresponding missing files array.

External Functions:
- pingPaths: This function takes an array of URLs as an argument and pings each URL using the http module's get method. It logs the URL and the response status code. It also listens for data chunks and appends them to a data variable. Once the response is complete, it logs the URL and the complete response data. If an error occurs during the request, it logs the error message.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the file system to create directories and copy files. It also interacts with external URLs by making HTTP requests and logging the response data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the PATHS array?
- How are the missing files arrays used?
- How can I modify the script to handle different file names or file types?
- How can I modify the script to handle different URLs or request methods?
- How can I handle errors during the file system operations or HTTP requests?
