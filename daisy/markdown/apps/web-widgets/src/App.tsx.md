Component:
The "App" component is a functional component that renders a chat widget. It takes in a prop called "iframeSrc" which is the source URL for the iframe inside the chat widget. The component uses the useState hook to manage the state of whether the chat widget is open or closed. It renders a div element that contains the chat widget and a button to toggle its visibility.

Hooks:
- useState: The useState hook is used to manage the state of whether the chat widget is open or closed. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state value.

Event Handlers:
- toggleChat: This event handler function is called when the button to toggle the chat widget is clicked. It uses the setIsChatOpen function from the useState hook to toggle the value of isChatOpen, which controls the visibility of the chat widget.

Rendered components:
- div: This div element contains the chat widget and the button to toggle its visibility. It has inline styles to position it fixed at the bottom right corner of the screen. It uses flexbox to align its contents vertically and has a maximum height of 80% of the viewport height.
- div (chat widget container): This div element contains the iframe that renders the chat widget. It has inline styles to control its visibility based on the value of isChatOpen. It has a flexGrow of 1 to take up the remaining space in the parent div. It also has a zIndex of 9999 to ensure it appears above other elements.
- iframe: This iframe element renders the chat widget using the provided iframeSrc prop as the source URL. It has inline styles to set its height and width to 100% and remove the border.
