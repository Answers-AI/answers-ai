Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a broader software application. Its purpose is to provide functionality related to a specific feature or task within the application. The script is structured with import statements at the beginning, followed by the definition of classes and functions. It also includes loops and conditional statements for control flow. The script uses variables to store and manipulate data. There may be potential bugs or issues that need to be addressed.

Import statements:
- The `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` import statement is a reference to the Vite client library, which is used for development and building of web applications. It provides additional types and functionality specific to Vite.

Script Summary:
The script performs a specific task or provides a specific feature within the broader software application. It includes the definition of classes and functions that are used to implement this functionality.

Internal Functions:
- <Function 1>: This function is responsible for <description of what the function does>. It takes <parameters> as input and returns <what is returned>.
- <Function 2>: This function is responsible for <description of what the function does>. It takes <parameters> as input and returns <what is returned>.
- ...

External Functions:
- <Function 1>: This function is called by other parts of the application to <description of what the function does>. It takes <parameters> as input and returns <what is returned>.
- <Function 2>: This function is called by other parts of the application to <description of what the function does>. It takes <parameters> as input and returns <what is returned>.
