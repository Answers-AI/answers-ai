Technical Document: Code Breakdown and API Description

File: query.ts

Summary:
This file contains the code for an API endpoint that handles queries related to a chat application. It receives a request with a prompt and other parameters, processes the request, and returns a response to the client.

Import statements:
- NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse: These are types imported from the 'next' package that define the request and response objects for Next.js API routes.
- getServerSession: This function is imported from the 'next-auth' package and is used to retrieve the server session for the current request.
- AnswersFilters, Message: These are types imported from the 'types' module and are used to define the structure of the request and response data.
- prisma: This is an instance of the Prisma client imported from the '@db/client' module. It is used to interact with the database.
- cors: This is a middleware function imported from the '@ui/cors' module. It is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API endpoint.
- inngest: This is an object imported from the '@utils/ingest/client' module. It provides a method for sending data to an external service.
- authOptions: This is an object imported from the '@ui/authOptions' module. It contains options for authentication.
- createChatChain: This is a function imported from the '@utils/llm/chains' module. It creates a chat chain for processing user queries.
- upsertChat: This is a function imported from the '@utils/upsertChat' module. It creates or updates a chat in the database.
- fetchContext: This is a function imported from the '@utils/pinecone/fetchContext' module. It fetches the context for a given prompt.

Internal Functions:
- handler: This is the main function that handles the API request. It is an asynchronous function that takes the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse objects as parameters. It performs various operations such as retrieving the server session, processing the request data, sending data to external services, and returning a response to the client.

External Services:
- Prisma: The Prisma client is used to interact with the database. It is responsible for creating and updating chat messages.
- Inngest: The inngest object is used to send data to an external service. It is used to send information about user queries and prompt answers.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/query
Summary: This endpoint handles a query request from the client. It expects a JSON payload containing the prompt, journeyId, chatId, filters, and messages. It processes the request, creates or updates a chat in the database, sends data to external services, and returns a response to the client.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "prompt": "How are you?",
  "journeyId": "123",
  "chatId": "456",
  "filters": {
    "category": "general"
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "content": "Hello",
      "role": "user"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "prompt": "How are you?",
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "I'm good, thank you.",
  "context": "context data",
  "filters": {
    "category": "general"
  },
  "pineconeData": {
    "data": "pinecone data"
  },
  "completionData": {
    "data": "completion data"
  },
  "completionRequest": {
    "data": "completion request"
  }
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The API endpoint receives a POST request with a JSON payload containing the prompt, journeyId, chatId, filters, and messages.
2. The server session is retrieved using the getServerSession function.
3. The chat is created or updated in the database using the upsertChat function.
4. Data about the user query is sent to the inngest service using the inngest.send function.
5. The context for the prompt is fetched using the fetchContext function.
6. The chat chain is created using the createChatChain function.
7. The chat chain is called with the prompt, context, user, messages, and agent_scratchpad.
8. The response from the chat chain is processed and a chat message is created in the database using the prisma.message.create function.
9. Data about the prompt answer is sent to the inngest service using the inngest.send function.
10. The response is returned to the client.

Developer Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the 'cors' middleware and why is it used in this API endpoint?
2. How does the 'upsertChat' function determine whether to create a new chat or update an existing one?
3. What is the role of the 'fetchContext' function and how does it fetch the context for a given prompt?
4. How is the 'createChatChain' function used to process user queries and generate responses?
5. What data is sent to the 'inngest' service and why is it sent?
6. Are there any known issues or limitations with this API endpoint?
7. Are there any TODO items or areas for improvement in this code?
