Technical Document: Code Breakdown and API Description

File: query.ts

This file contains the code for an API endpoint that handles queries related to a chat application. It interacts with various dependencies and external services to process user queries and provide responses. Let's break down the code and describe its functionality within the context of the larger application.

Import Statements:
- `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` are imported from the 'next' package. These types define the request and response objects for the Next.js API routes.
- `getServerSession` is imported from 'next-auth' package. It is used to retrieve the server session for the authenticated user.
- `AnswersFilters` and `Message` are imported from the 'types' module. These types define the structure of the filters and messages used in the application.
- `prisma` is imported from the '@db/client' module. It is the Prisma client used to interact with the database.
- `cors` is imported from the '@ui/cors' module. It is a middleware function that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the API endpoint.
- `inngest` is imported from the '@utils/ingest/client' module. It is a service used to send data to an external system.
- `authOptions` is imported from the '@ui/authOptions' module. It contains options for authentication.
- `createChatChain` is imported from the '@utils/llm/chains' module. It is a function that creates a chat chain for processing user queries.
- `upsertChat` is imported from the '@utils/upsertChat' module. It is a function that creates or updates a chat in the database.
- `fetchContext` is imported from the '@utils/pinecone/fetchContext' module. It is a function that retrieves context data for the query.

Internal Functions:
- `handler`: This is the main function that handles the API request and response. It is an asynchronous function that takes the request and response objects as parameters. It performs the following steps:
  - Calls the `cors` middleware function to enable CORS for the API endpoint.
  - Retrieves the server session using `getServerSession` and `authOptions`.
  - Extracts the necessary data from the request body, including `messages`, `journeyId`, `chatId`, `filters`, and `prompt`.
  - Checks if the user is authenticated by validating the presence of the user's email. If not authenticated, it sets the response status to 401 (Unauthorized) and returns.
  - Calls the `upsertChat` function to create or update the chat in the database.
  - Sends a message to the external system using `inngest.send` to track the user's query.
  - Sends a message to the external system using `inngest.send` to track the prompt being upserted.
  - Calls the `fetchContext` function to retrieve context data for the query.
  - Creates a chat chain using `createChatChain` and the provided `messages`.
  - Calls the `call` method of the chat chain to process the user's query and get a response.
  - Creates a message in the database using `prisma.message.create`.
  - Sends a message to the external system using `inngest.send` to track the prompt being answered.
  - Sends the response back to the client with status 200 (OK) and includes various data such as the message, chat, prompt, role, content, context, filters, pineconeData, completionData, and completionRequest.
  - If any error occurs during the process, it catches the error, logs it, and sends an error response to the client with status 500 (Internal Server Error).

External Services:
- Prisma: The `prisma` client is used to interact with the database. It is responsible for creating and retrieving chat messages.
- Inngest: The `inngest` service is used to send data to an external system. It is used to track user queries, upserted prompts, and answered prompts.
- Chat Chain: The `createChatChain` function creates a chat chain that processes user queries and generates responses based on the provided messages.
- Authentication: The `getServerSession` function is used to retrieve the server session for the authenticated user. It uses the `authOptions` to configure the authentication options.

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/query
  Summary: This endpoint handles user queries and returns a response based on the provided input.
  Example Usage:
  ```
  curl -X POST \
    http://localhost:3000/api/query \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "journeyId": "123",
    "chatId": "456",
    "content": "Hello",
    "messages": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "content": "Hi",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    ],
    "filters": {
      "category": "general"
    }
  }'
  ```
  Example Response:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "123",
    "chatId": "456",
    "prompt": "Hello",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Hi, how can I assist you?",
    "context": "context data",
    "filters": {
      "category": "general"
    },
    "pineconeData": {
      "data": "pinecone data"
    },
    "completionData": {
      "data": "completion data"
    },
    "completionRequest": {
      "request": "completion request"
    }
  }
  ```

Interaction Summary:
The code in this file handles user queries by processing them through a chat chain and generating responses based on the provided messages. It interacts with the Prisma database to create and retrieve chat messages. It also sends data to an external system using the Inngest service to track user queries, upserted prompts, and answered prompts. The code utilizes authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can send queries.

Developer Questions:
1. How does the `createChatChain` function work and what messages should be provided?
2. What data is stored in the `chat` object and how is it used?
3. How does the `fetchContext` function retrieve context data for the query?
4. What is the purpose of the `inngest.send` calls and what data is sent to the external system?
5. Are there any known issues or limitations with this code?
6. Are there any TODO items or areas for improvement in this file?
