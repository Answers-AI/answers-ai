Summary:
This script initializes and configures the Sentry error tracking service for a Next.js application. It sets up the necessary configuration options and error handling behavior. The script plays a crucial role in monitoring and reporting errors that occur within the application.

Import statements:
- `import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';`: This imports the Sentry library for Next.js, which provides error tracking and monitoring capabilities.

Script Summary:
The script initializes and configures the Sentry error tracking service. It sets the DSN (Data Source Name) for the Sentry project, defines a beforeSend callback function to handle error events, and sets the tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to enable tracing for all requests.

Internal Functions:
- `beforeSend`: This function is a callback that is executed before sending an error event to Sentry. It logs the event to the console and checks if the event contains an exception. If an exception is present, it shows a report dialog to the user with the event ID. The function returns the event object.

External Functions:
- `Sentry.init(options)`: This function initializes the Sentry error tracking service with the provided options. It takes an options object as a parameter, which includes the DSN, beforeSend callback, and tracesSampleRate.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the Sentry service by initializing it with the provided configuration options. It also interacts with the application by logging error events and showing a report dialog when an exception occurs.
