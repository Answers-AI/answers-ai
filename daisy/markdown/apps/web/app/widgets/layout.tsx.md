Summary:
This file exports a React component called WidgetLayout. It is a server-side component that is responsible for rendering the layout of a widget in the larger application. It interacts with other components such as AppWidgetLayout and flagsmith.

Import statements:
- getServerSession and Session are imported from 'next-auth' to handle server-side authentication.
- authOptions is imported from '@ui/authOptions' to provide authentication options.
- AppWidgetLayout is imported from '@ui/AppWidgetLayout' to render the widget layout.
- React is imported from 'react' to use React components.
- flagsmith is imported from 'flagsmith/isomorphic' to handle feature flag management.

Component:
The WidgetLayout component is an async function that accepts two props: children and params. It awaits the server session using getServerSession and authOptions. It then initializes flagsmith with the provided environment ID and prevents fetching flags on the server. If the session has a user with an email, it identifies the user with flagsmith using their user ID and additional information. Finally, it gets the current state of flagsmith and renders the AppWidgetLayout component with the session, params, and flagsmithState as props.

Hooks:

Rendered components:

Interaction Summary:
