File: [filename]

API Summary:
This file contains code for handling API endpoints related to a larger application. It includes functions for handling GET, DELETE, and PATCH requests. These endpoints interact with a database using Prisma and require authentication using NextAuth.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the 'next/server' module. It is used to handle the response sent back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the 'next-auth' module. It is used to retrieve the user session from the server.
- `prisma` is imported from the '@db/client' module. It is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the '@ui/authOptions' module. It contains options for authentication.

Internal Functions:
1. `GET(req: Request, res: Response)`: This function handles the GET request. It retrieves the user session, checks if the user is authenticated, and then fetches records from the database based on the user's email. The records are returned as a JSON response.

2. `DELETE(req: Request, res: Response)`: This function handles the DELETE request. It retrieves the user session, checks if the user is authenticated, and then extracts the 'id' parameter from the request URL. It finds a record in the database with the given id and the user's email, deletes it, and returns the id as a JSON response.

3. `PATCH(req: Request, res: Response)`: This function handles the PATCH request. It retrieves the user session, checks if the user is authenticated, and then extracts the 'id', 'likes', and 'dislikes' parameters from the request body. It updates the record in the database with the given id, setting the 'likes' and 'dislikes' fields to the provided values, and returns the id as a JSON response.

External Services:
- Prisma: The code interacts with the Prisma ORM to perform database operations. It uses the `prisma` object imported from the '@db/client' module.

API Endpoints:
1. GET /api/route
Summary: This endpoint retrieves records from the database based on the authenticated user's email.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "data": "data"
}'
```
Example Response:
```json
{
  "response": "data"
}
```

2. DELETE /api/route?id=<id>
Summary: This endpoint deletes a record from the database based on the authenticated user's email and the provided id parameter.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X DELETE \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/route?id=123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache'
```
Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": "123"
}
```

3. PATCH /api/route
Summary: This endpoint updates a record in the database based on the authenticated user's email and the provided id, likes, and dislikes parameters.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X PATCH \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "id": "123",
  "likes": 5,
  "dislikes": 2
}'
```
Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": "123"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
The code in this file handles three API endpoints: GET, DELETE, and PATCH. Each endpoint requires authentication using NextAuth and interacts with the database using Prisma. The GET endpoint retrieves records from the database based on the authenticated user's email. The DELETE endpoint deletes a record from the database based on the authenticated user's email and the provided id. The PATCH endpoint updates a record in the database based on the authenticated user's email and the provided id, likes, and dislikes.

Developer Questions:
1. How is authentication handled in this code?
2. What are the required fields for the PATCH request?
3. Are there any additional validation or error handling mechanisms in place?
4. How can I test these API endpoints locally?
5. Are there any known issues or limitations with this code?

TODO Items:
- Validate which fields are allowed to be updated in the PATCH request.
- Add more detailed error handling and logging.

Known Issues:
None at the moment.
