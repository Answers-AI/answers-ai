API Summary:
This file contains code for handling API endpoints related to a larger application. It includes functions for handling GET, DELETE, and PATCH requests. These endpoints interact with a database using Prisma and require authentication using NextAuth.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the 'next/server' module. It is used to handle the response sent back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the 'next-auth' module. It is used to retrieve the user session from the server.
- `prisma` is imported from the '@db/client' module. It is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the '@ui/authOptions' module. It contains options for authentication.

Internal Functions:
1. `GET(req: Request, res: Response)`: This function handles the GET request. It retrieves the user session, checks if the user is authenticated, and then fetches records from the database based on the user's email. The records are returned as a JSON response.

2. `DELETE(req: Request, res: Response)`: This function handles the DELETE request. It retrieves the user session, checks if the user is authenticated, and then extracts the 'id' parameter from the request URL. It finds a record in the database with the given 'id' and the user's email, deletes it, and returns the 'id' as a JSON response.

3. `PATCH(req: Request, res: Response)`: This function handles the PATCH request. It retrieves the user session, checks if the user is authenticated, and then extracts the 'id', 'likes', and 'dislikes' parameters from the request body. It updates the record in the database with the given 'id' and sets the 'likes' and 'dislikes' fields to the provided values. It returns the 'id' as a JSON response.

External Services:
- The code interacts with a database using Prisma. It uses the `prisma` object to perform database operations such as fetching records, deleting records, and updating records.

API Endpoints:
1. GET /api/route
Summary: This endpoint retrieves records from the database based on the user's email.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "data": "data"
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "response": "data"
}
```

2. DELETE /api/route?id=<id>
Summary: This endpoint deletes a record from the database based on the provided 'id' parameter.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route?id=123 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": "123"
}
```

3. PATCH /api/route
Summary: This endpoint updates a record in the database based on the provided 'id', 'likes', and 'dislikes' parameters.
Example Usage:
```
curl -X PATCH \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "id": "123",
  "likes": 5,
  "dislikes": 2
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": "123"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
- The code interacts with the Next.js server to handle incoming requests and send responses back to the client.
- It uses the NextAuth library to retrieve the user session and perform authentication checks.
- The code interacts with the Prisma client to perform database operations such as fetching, deleting, and updating records.

Developer Questions:
1. How is the authentication handled in this code?
2. What are the allowed fields that can be updated in the PATCH request?
3. Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for database operations?
4. How can I test these API endpoints locally?
5. Are there any known issues or limitations with this code?

TODO Items:
- Validate which fields are allowed to be updated in the PATCH request.

Known Issues:
- None.
