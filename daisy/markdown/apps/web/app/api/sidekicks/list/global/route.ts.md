API Summary:
This code file contains a single API endpoint that handles a GET request to the "/api/route" route. The endpoint requires authentication and retrieves a list of sidekicks from a database. The sidekicks are then normalized and returned as a JSON response.

Import statements:
- The code imports the `NextResponse` object from the `next/server` module, which is used to send responses back to the client.
- The `getServerSession` function is imported from the `next-auth` module, which is used to retrieve the user session.
- The `prisma` object is imported from the `@db/client` module, which is the database client used to interact with the database.
- The `authOptions` object is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module, which contains options for session authentication.
- The `normalizeSidekickList` function is imported from the `normalizeSidekick` module, which is a utility function for normalizing sidekick data.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request. It takes a `req` parameter, which represents the incoming request object. The function is asynchronous and returns a `NextResponse` object.
- `normalizeSidekickList`: This function takes a list of sidekicks and a user object as parameters. It normalizes the sidekick data by adding a `favorited` property to each sidekick based on whether the user has favorited it or not. The function returns the normalized sidekick list.

External Services:
- The code interacts with a database using the `prisma` object. It retrieves a list of sidekicks from the database and includes the favoritedBy relationship for each sidekick.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/route
Summary: This endpoint retrieves a list of sidekicks from the database and returns the normalized sidekick list as a JSON response.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "data": "data"
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "response": "data"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The code imports necessary modules and functions.
2. The `GET` function is defined to handle the GET request.
3. The function retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and redirects to the "/auth" route if the user is not authenticated.
4. The user ID is extracted from the session.
5. The code queries the database using `prisma` to retrieve a list of sidekicks that are marked as global.
6. The favoritedBy relationship is included in the query to determine if each sidekick is favorited by the user.
7. The retrieved sidekicks are normalized using the `normalizeSidekickList` function.
8. The normalized sidekicks are returned as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

Developer Questions:
1. How is the authentication handled in this code?
2. What is the purpose of the `normalizeSidekickList` function and how does it work?
3. Are there any potential performance issues with querying the database for sidekicks and including the favoritedBy relationship for each sidekick?
4. Are there any known issues or limitations with this code file?
5. Are there any TODO items related to this code file?
