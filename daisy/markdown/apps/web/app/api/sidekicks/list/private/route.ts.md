API Summary:
This file contains code for a GET endpoint that retrieves a list of sidekicks associated with a user. The endpoint requires authentication and returns a JSON response containing the sidekicks.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the 'next/server' module and is used to create the response object.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the 'next-auth' module and is used to retrieve the user session.
- `prisma` is imported from the '@db/client' module and is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the '@ui/authOptions' module and contains options for session authentication.
- `respond401` is imported from the '@utils/auth/respond401' module and is used to handle unauthorized requests.
- `normalizeSidekickList` is imported from the '../../../../../utilities/normalizeSidekick' module and is used to normalize the sidekick data.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This function is the main entry point for the GET endpoint. It takes a `req` parameter representing the incoming request and returns a response object. It performs the following steps:
  - Retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and `authOptions`.
  - Checks if the session exists and if the user ID is present. If not, it returns a 401 unauthorized response using `respond401`.
  - Retrieves the user ID from the session.
  - Queries the database using `prisma` to fetch sidekicks associated with the user. It includes the favoritedBy relationship to check if the user has favorited any sidekicks.
  - Normalizes the sidekick data using `normalizeSidekickList`.
  - Returns a JSON response containing the normalized sidekicks using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- Database: The code interacts with the database using the `prisma` client to fetch sidekick data associated with the user.

API Endpoints:
