API Summary:
This file contains code for a GET endpoint that retrieves a list of sidekicks from a database. The endpoint requires authentication and returns the sidekicks that are associated with the current user's organization. The response is in JSON format.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the 'next/server' module and is used to send responses back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the 'next-auth' module and is used to retrieve the current user's session.
- `prisma` is imported from the '@db/client' module and is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the '@ui/authOptions' module and contains options for authentication.
- `normalizeSidekickList` is imported from the '../../../../../utilities/normalizeSidekick' module and is used to normalize the sidekick data.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request. It takes a `req` parameter representing the request object. It first retrieves the current user's session using `getServerSession` and checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it redirects the user to the '/auth' page. Then, it retrieves the user's ID and queries the database for sidekicks associated with the user's organization. The retrieved sidekicks are then normalized using the `normalizeSidekickList` function. Finally, the normalized sidekicks are returned as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- Database: The code interacts with the database using the `prisma` client to retrieve sidekicks associated with the user's organization.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/sidekicks
Summary: Retrieves a list of sidekicks associated with the current user's organization.
