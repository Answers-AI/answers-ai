API Summary:
This file contains code for a GET API endpoint that retrieves a list of sidekicks from a database. The sidekicks are filtered based on a specific condition and are then normalized before being returned as a JSON response.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module and is used to send the response back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module and is used to retrieve the user session.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module and is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module and contains options for session authentication.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module and is used to handle unauthorized requests.
- `normalizeSidekickList` is imported from the `../../../../../utilities/normalizeSidekick` module and is used to normalize the sidekick data.
- `Sidekick` is imported from the `types` module and represents the structure of a sidekick object.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This function is the main entry point for the API endpoint. It takes a `req` parameter of type `Request` and returns a `NextResponse` object. It performs the following steps:
  - Retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and `authOptions`.
  - Checks if the session exists and if the user ID is present. If not, it returns a 401 unauthorized response using `respond401`.
  - Retrieves the user object from the session.
  - Queries the database using `prisma.sidekick.findMany` to fetch sidekicks that have the `isSystem` property set to `true`. It also includes the `favoritedBy` relation, filtering only the sidekicks favorited by the current user.
  - Normalizes the sidekick data using `normalizeSidekickList` and the user object.
  - Returns the normalized sidekicks as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- Database: The code interacts with the database using the `prisma` client to fetch sidekick data.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/route
Summary: This endpoint retrieves a list of sidekicks from the database that are marked as system sidekicks and have been favorited by the current user. The sidekicks are then normalized before being returned as a JSON response.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "data": "data"
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "response": "data"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
The code imports necessary modules and dependencies, including the `NextResponse` class for sending responses, the `getServerSession` function for retrieving the user session, and the `prisma` client for interacting with the database. It also imports utility functions for authentication and data normalization.

The `GET` function is the entry point for the API endpoint. It retrieves the user session, checks for authentication, and fetches sidekicks from the database based on specific criteria. The sidekicks are then normalized and returned as a JSON response.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the `normalizeSidekickList` function and how does it work?
- How can I modify the database query to include additional filters or sorting options?
- Are there any known issues or limitations with this API endpoint?
- Are there any TODO items related to this file that need to be addressed?
