API Summary:
This file contains code for a GET API endpoint that retrieves a list of sidekicks from a database. The sidekicks are filtered based on a specific condition and are then normalized before being returned as a JSON response.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module. It is used to send the response back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module. It is used to retrieve the user session from the server.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is the database client used to query the sidekicks.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module. It contains the options for authentication.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module. It is a utility function to handle unauthorized requests.
- `normalizeSidekickList` is imported from the `../../../../../utilities/normalizeSidekick` module. It is a utility function to normalize the sidekick data.
- `Sidekick` is imported from the `types` module. It is the type definition for a sidekick object.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request. It takes a `req` parameter of type `Request`. It retrieves the user session, checks if the user is authenticated, queries the database for sidekicks, normalizes the sidekick data, and returns the normalized sidekicks as a JSON response.

External Services:
- The code interacts with a database using the `prisma` client to query for sidekicks.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/sidekicks
Summary: Retrieves a list of sidekicks from the database and returns them as a JSON response.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/sidekicks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache'
```

Example Response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sidekick 1",
    "isSystem": true,
    "favoritedBy": [
      {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "User 1"
      },
      {
        "id": 456,
        "name": "User 2"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Sidekick 2",
    "isSystem": true,
    "favoritedBy": [
      {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "User 1"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The code imports necessary modules and dependencies.
2. The `GET` function is defined to handle the GET request.
3. The function retrieves the user session using `getServerSession`.
4. If the user is not authenticated, the function returns a 401 Unauthorized response using `respond401`.
5. If the user is authenticated, the function retrieves the user object from the session.
6. The function queries the database using `prisma.sidekick.findMany` to retrieve sidekicks that have `isSystem` set to true.
7. The query includes the `favoritedBy` relation, filtering only the sidekicks favorited by the current user.
8. The function normalizes the sidekick data using `normalizeSidekickList`.
9. The normalized sidekicks are returned as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

Developer Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the `normalizeSidekickList` function and how does it work?
2. How can I modify the query to retrieve sidekicks based on different conditions?
3. What other functions or utilities are available in the `@utils/auth` module?
4. Are there any known issues or limitations with this code?
