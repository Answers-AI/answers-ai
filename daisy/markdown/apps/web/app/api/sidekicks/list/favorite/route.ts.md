API Summary:
This file contains code for a GET endpoint that retrieves a list of sidekicks favorited by a user. It requires authentication using NextAuth and interacts with a Prisma database to fetch the sidekicks. The response is a JSON object containing the normalized sidekick list.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module to handle the response.
- `getServerSession` is imported from `next-auth` to retrieve the user session.
- `prisma` is imported from `@db/client` to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from `@ui/authOptions` to configure the authentication options.
- `respond401` is imported from `@utils/auth/respond401` to handle unauthorized requests.
- `normalizeSidekickList` is imported from `../../../../../utilities/normalizeSidekick` to normalize the sidekick data.
- `Sidekick` is imported from `types` to define the type of sidekick objects.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request. It takes a `req` parameter of type `Request`. It retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it returns a 401 unauthorized response using `respond401`. If authenticated, it fetches the sidekicks favorited by the user from the database using `prisma.sidekick.findMany`. It includes the favoritedBy relationship to filter the sidekicks by the user's ID. The fetched sidekicks are then normalized using `normalizeSidekickList`. Finally, it returns a JSON response containing the normalized sidekick list using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- NextAuth: This code relies on NextAuth for authentication. It uses the `getServerSession` function to retrieve the user session.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/sidekicks
Summary: Retrieves a list of sidekicks favorited by the authenticated user.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/api/sidekicks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "sidekicks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Sidekick 1",
      "favoritedBy": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "User 1"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Sidekick 2",
      "favoritedBy": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "User 1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The GET request is received at the `/api/sidekicks` endpoint.
2. The user session is retrieved using `getServerSession`.
3. If the user is not authenticated, a 401 unauthorized response is returned.
4. If authenticated, the sidekicks favorited by the user are fetched from the database using `prisma.sidekick.findMany`.
5. The fetched sidekicks are normalized using `normalizeSidekickList`.
6. The normalized sidekick list is returned as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

Developer Questions:
- How is the authentication handled in this code?
- What is the structure of the normalized sidekick list?
- Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for database or session retrieval errors?

TODO Items:
- Add error handling for database or session retrieval errors.
- Consider adding pagination support for large sidekick lists.

Known Issues:
- None.
