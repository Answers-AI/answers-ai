API Summary:
This file contains a PATCH endpoint for updating a favorite sidekick in a larger application. The endpoint requires authentication and interacts with a database using Prisma.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module and is used to send responses back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module and is used to retrieve the user session.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module and is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module and contains options for authentication.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module and is used to send a 401 unauthorized response.

Internal Functions:
- `PATCH`: This function is the main entry point for the PATCH endpoint. It takes in the request (`req`), route parameters (`{ params: { id } }`), and response (`res`) as parameters. It first retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it calls `respond401` to send a 401 unauthorized response. It then checks if the `id` parameter is present and throws an error if it's missing. Next, it retrieves the sidekick from the database using `prisma.sidekick.findUnique`, including the `favoritedBy` relation. If the sidekick doesn't exist, it calls `respond401` to send a 401 unauthorized response. It then checks if the user has already favorited the sidekick and constructs the `data` object accordingly. Finally, it updates the user's favorite sidekicks using `prisma.user.update` and returns a success response using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- Database: The code interacts with a database using Prisma. It retrieves the sidekick and updates the user's favorite sidekicks.

API Endpoints:
- PATCH /api/sidekicks/:id
  - Summary: This endpoint is used to update the favorite status of a sidekick for the authenticated user.
  - Example Usage:
    ```
    curl -X PATCH \
      http://localhost:3000/api/sidekicks/123 \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
    ```
  - Example Response:

    {
      "response": "Success"
    }
    ```

Interaction Summary:
The PATCH endpoint in this file allows authenticated users to update the favorite status of a sidekick. It first checks if the user is authenticated and if the required parameters are present. Then, it retrieves the sidekick from the database and checks if the user has already favorited it. Based on this information, it constructs the data object for updating the user's favorite sidekicks. Finally, it updates the user's favorite sidekicks and returns a success response.

Developer Questions:
- What authentication method is used for the `getServerSession` function?
- What is the structure of the `favoritedBy` relation in the sidekick model?
- Are there any additional error cases that should be handled in the PATCH endpoint?
- Are there any performance considerations when updating the user's favorite sidekicks?
