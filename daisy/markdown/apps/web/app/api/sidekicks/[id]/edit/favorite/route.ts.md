API Summary:
This file contains a PATCH endpoint for updating a favorite sidekick in a larger application. The endpoint requires authentication and interacts with a database using Prisma ORM.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module and is used to send responses back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module and is used to retrieve the user session.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module and is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module and contains options for authentication.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module and is used to send a 401 unauthorized response.

Internal Functions:
- `PATCH`: This function is the main entry point for the PATCH endpoint. It takes in the request (`req`), route parameters (`{ params: { id } }`), and response (`res`) as parameters. It first retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it returns a 401 unauthorized response using `respond401`. It then retrieves the sidekick ID from the route parameters and the user ID from the session. It queries the database to find the sidekick by ID and includes the favoritedBy relation. If the sidekick does not exist, it returns a 401 unauthorized response. It checks if the user has already favorited the sidekick and constructs the data object for updating the user's favoritedSidekicks field. It then updates the user in the database using `prisma.user.update` and returns a success response using `NextResponse.json`. If there is an error during the process, it returns an error response with a status of 422.

External Services:
- Database: The code interacts with a database using Prisma ORM. It uses the `prisma` client to query and update the database.

Interaction Summary:
The PATCH endpoint in this file is responsible for updating the favorite status of a sidekick for the authenticated user. It first checks if the user is authenticated and retrieves the sidekick and user IDs. It then queries the database to find the sidekick and checks if the user has already favorited it. Based on the result, it constructs the data object for updating the user's favoritedSidekicks field. It then updates the user in the database and returns a success response. If there is an error, it returns an error response.
