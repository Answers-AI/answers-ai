**API Summary:**

This file contains code for a GET API endpoint that retrieves a sidekick object based on its ID. The endpoint requires authentication using NextAuth and returns the sidekick object if it exists and is accessible to the authenticated user. The endpoint also handles error cases where the sidekick ID is not provided or the sidekick is not found.

**Import statements:**

- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module. It is used to construct the response sent back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module. It is used to retrieve the authenticated session.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module. It contains options for the authentication process.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module. It is used to handle unauthorized requests.

**Internal Functions:**

- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request. It takes the request object (`req`) and an object containing the route parameters (`{ params: { id } }`). It first retrieves the authenticated session using `getServerSession` and stores the user ID in the `userId` variable. If the user ID is not available, it returns a 401 unauthorized response using `respond401`. If the `id` parameter is not provided, it returns a JSON response with an error message. Otherwise, it queries the database using `prisma.sidekick.findFirst` to find the sidekick object based on the provided ID and the user's access permissions. If the sidekick is not found, it returns a JSON response with an error message. Otherwise, it returns a JSON response with the sidekick object.

**External Services:**

- NextAuth: This code relies on NextAuth for authentication. It uses the `getServerSession` function to retrieve the authenticated session.

**API Endpoints:**

- GET /api/sidekick
  - Summary: Retrieves a sidekick object based on its ID.
  - Example Usage:
    ```
    curl -X GET \
      http://localhost:3000/api/sidekick \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
      -d '{
      "id": "123"
    }'
    ```
  - Example Response:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "Example Sidekick",
      "description": "This is an example sidekick"
    }
    ```

**Interaction Summary:**

The code in this file handles a GET request to retrieve a sidekick object. It first checks the user's authentication status using NextAuth and retrieves the authenticated session. Then, it queries the database to find the sidekick object based on the provided ID and the user's access permissions. If the sidekick is found, it returns the sidekick object as a JSON response. If the sidekick ID is not provided or the sidekick is not found, it returns an appropriate error message.

**Developer Questions:**

- How is the authentication process configured with NextAuth?
- What are the possible access permissions for a sidekick object?
- How can I test this API endpoint locally?
- Are there any additional error cases that should be handled?

**TODO items or known issues related to this file:**

- The code currently logs an error message to the console when an error occurs. Consider improving error handling and logging.
- The code could benefit from additional comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each section and any complex logic.
