**API Summary:**

This file contains code for a GET API endpoint that retrieves a sidekick object based on its ID. The endpoint requires authentication using NextAuth and Next.js server-side rendering. The endpoint checks if the user is authenticated and then retrieves the sidekick object from the database. The response is returned as JSON.

**Import statements:**

- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module. It is used to send responses back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module. It is used to retrieve the user session.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is the database client used to query the sidekick object.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module. It contains the authentication options for `getServerSession`.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module. It is a utility function to handle unauthorized requests.

**Internal Functions:**

- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request. It takes two parameters: `req` (the request object) and `{ params: { id } }` (an object containing the `id` parameter from the request URL). It is an async function that performs the following steps:
  - Calls `getServerSession` with `authOptions` to retrieve the user session.
  - Checks if the `userId` is present in the session. If not, it returns a 401 unauthorized response using `respond401`.
  - Checks if the `id` parameter is provided. If not, it returns a JSON response with an error message.
  - Uses `prisma.sidekick.findFirst` to query the sidekick object from the database. The query checks if the sidekick is created by the user, is marked as global, or is shared with the user's organization.
  - If the sidekick object is not found, it returns a JSON response with an error message.
  - Otherwise, it returns a JSON response with the sidekick object.

**External Services:**

- NextAuth: This code uses NextAuth for authentication. It relies on the `getServerSession` function to retrieve the user session.

**API Endpoints:**

- GET /api/sidekick
  - Summary: Retrieves a sidekick object based on its ID.
