**API Summary:**

This file contains a single API endpoint that handles GET requests to the `/api` route. The endpoint retrieves a list of documents from a database based on certain criteria and returns the results to the client.

**Import statements:**

- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module. It is used to construct the response that will be sent back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module. It is used to retrieve the user session from the server.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that provides an interface to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module. It contains configuration options for the authentication system.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module. It is a utility function that constructs a 401 Unauthorized response.
- `getUrlDomain` is imported from the `@utils/getUrlDomain` module. It is a utility function that extracts the domain from a URL.

**Internal Functions:**

- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request to the `/api` route. It takes a `req` parameter of type `Request` and returns a `NextResponse` object. It performs the following steps:
  1. Retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and `authOptions`.
  2. Checks if the user session exists and contains a valid user ID. If not, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response using `respond401`.
  3. Extracts the `url` parameter from the request URL's search parameters.
  4. Queries the database using `prisma.document.findMany` to retrieve a list of documents that meet the specified criteria. The criteria include filtering by the `source` field, the `url` field (if provided), and the `permissions` field to ensure the user has access to the document.
  5. If a `url` parameter is provided, it extracts the domain from the URL using `getUrlDomain` and queries the database to count the number of documents with the same domain.
  6. Constructs the response body with the retrieved documents and domain information.
  7. Returns a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

**External Services:**

- The code interacts with a database using the `prisma` ORM. It queries the `document` table to retrieve documents based on certain criteria.

**API Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/route`
  - Summary: This endpoint retrieves a list of documents from the database based on certain criteria and returns the results to the client.
  - Example Usage:
    ```
    curl -X GET \
      http://localhost:3000/api/route \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
      -d '{
      "data": "data"
    }'
    ```
  - Example Response:
    ```json
    {
      "sources": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.com/document1",
          "title": "Document 1",
          "repo": "Document 1"
        },
        {
          "url": "https://example.com/document2",
          "title": "Document 2",
          "repo": "Document 2"
        }
      ],
      "domains": [
        {
          "domain": "example.com",
          "pageCount": 2
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

**Interaction Summary:**

The code in this file handles GET requests to the `/api` route. It retrieves documents from the database based on certain criteria, such as the source, URL, and user permissions. It also counts the number of documents with the same domain as the provided URL. The retrieved documents and domain information are then returned as a JSON response to the client.

**Developer Questions:**

- What other criteria can be used to filter the documents?
- How can the code be modified to handle pagination of the results?
- Are there any performance considerations when querying the database for documents with the same domain?

**TODO:**

- Ensure this only shows documents owned by the user.
- Implement pagination for the results.
- Address any performance issues related to querying documents with the same domain.

**Known Issues:**

- None.
