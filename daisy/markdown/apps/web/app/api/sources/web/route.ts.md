**API Summary:**

This file contains a single API endpoint that handles GET requests to the `/api` route. The endpoint retrieves a list of documents from a database based on certain criteria and returns the results to the client.

**Import statements:**

- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module. It is used to construct the response that will be sent back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module. It is used to retrieve the user session from the server.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that provides an interface to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module. It contains configuration options for the authentication system.
- `respond401` is imported from the `@utils/auth/respond401` module. It is a utility function that constructs a 401 Unauthorized response.
- `getUrlDomain` is imported from the `@utils/getUrlDomain` module. It is a utility function that extracts the domain from a URL.

**Internal Functions:**

- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request to the `/api` route. It takes a `req` parameter representing the incoming request. It performs the following steps:
  1. Retrieves the user session using `getServerSession` and the `authOptions` configuration.
  2. Checks if the session exists and if the user ID is present. If not, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response using `respond401`.
  3. Extracts the `url` parameter from the request URL's search parameters.
  4. Queries the database using `prisma.document.findMany` to retrieve a list of documents that meet the specified criteria. The criteria include filtering by the `source` field, the `url` field (if provided), and the user's permissions. It also selects only the `url` and `title` fields and limits the result to 100 records.
  5. Initializes an empty array `domains`.
  6. If the `url` parameter is provided, extracts the domain from it using `getUrlDomain`.
  7. If a domain is extracted, queries the database using `prisma.document.count` to count the number of documents with the same domain.
  8. If a domain is found, adds an object with the domain and the count to the `domains` array.
  9. Maps the filtered records to a new array of objects containing the `url`, `title`, and `repo` fields.
  10. Constructs a JSON response using `NextResponse.json` with the `sources` and `domains` arrays as the payload.

**External Services:**

- The code interacts with a database using the Prisma ORM (`prisma`).
- It also uses the Next.js server (`NextResponse`) and authentication library (`getServerSession`) for handling the request and session management.

**API Endpoints:**

- GET /api/route
  - Summary: This endpoint retrieves a list of documents from the database based on certain criteria and returns the results to the client.
  - Example Usage:
    ```
    curl -X GET \
      http://localhost:3000/api/route \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
      -d '{
      "data": "data"
    }'
    ```
  - Example Response:
    ```json
    {
      "sources": [
        {
          "url": "https://example.com",
          "title": "Example Document",
          "repo": "Example Document"
        }
      ],
      "domains": [
        {
          "domain": "example.com",
          "pageCount": 1
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

**Interaction Summary:**

The code in this file handles GET requests to the `/api` route. It retrieves a list of documents from the database based on certain criteria, such as the source, URL, and user permissions. It also counts the number of documents with the same domain as the provided URL. The filtered records are then returned to the client as a JSON response.

**Developer Questions:**

- What other criteria can be used to filter the documents?
- How can the number of records returned be increased or decreased?
- How can the authentication options be customized?
- Are there any performance considerations when querying the database for large datasets?
- How can the code be tested?

**TODO:**

- Ensure this only shows documents owned by the user.
- Improve error handling and error responses.
- Add unit tests for the `GET` function.
- Consider pagination for large result sets.

**Known Issues:**

- None at the moment.
