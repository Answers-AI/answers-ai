API Summary:
This code file contains a single API endpoint that handles a GET request to the "/api/route" route. The endpoint retrieves a user's session, checks if the user is authenticated, and then fetches a list of documents owned by the user from a database. The endpoint filters the documents based on certain criteria and returns the filtered list as a JSON response.

Import statements:
- The code imports the `NextResponse` object from the `next/server` module, which is used to send responses to the client.
- The `getServerSession` function is imported from the `next-auth` module, which is used to retrieve the user's session.
- The `prisma` object is imported from the `@db/client` module, which is the database client used to interact with the database.
- The `authOptions` object is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module, which contains options for authentication.

Internal Functions:
- `GET`: This is the main function that handles the GET request to the "/api/route" route. It takes in a `req` (Request) object and a `res` (Response) object as parameters. It retrieves the user's session using the `getServerSession` function and checks if the user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects the user to the "/auth" route. Otherwise, it fetches a list of documents owned by the user from the database using the `prisma.document.findMany` method. The fetched documents are filtered based on certain criteria and the filtered list is returned as a JSON response using the `NextResponse.json` method.

External Services:
- The code interacts with the Next.js server to handle the API request and send the response.
- The code uses the NextAuth library to retrieve the user's session.
- The code uses the Prisma ORM to interact with the database and fetch the documents.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/route
Summary: This endpoint retrieves a list of documents owned by the user and returns the filtered list as a JSON response.

Example Usage:

}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "Document 1",
      "metadata": {
        "repo": "https://github.com/user/repo1"
      }
    },
    {
      "title": "Document 2",
      "metadata": {
        "repo": "https://github.com/user/repo2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The client sends a GET request to the "/api/route" route.
2. The server receives the request and passes it to the `GET` function.
3. The `GET` function retrieves the user's session using `getServerSession`.
4. If the user is not authenticated, the function redirects the user to the "/auth" route.
5. If the user is authenticated, the function fetches a list of documents owned by the user from the database using `prisma.document.findMany`.
6. The fetched documents are filtered based on certain criteria.
7. The filtered list of documents is returned as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.
