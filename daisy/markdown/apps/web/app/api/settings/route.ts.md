**API Summary:**

This file contains two API endpoints, one for handling GET requests and one for handling POST requests. The GET endpoint retrieves the application settings and returns them as a JSON response. The POST endpoint updates the application settings based on the request payload and returns the updated settings as a JSON response.

**Import statements:**

- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module. It is used to create HTTP responses in Next.js.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module. It is used to retrieve the server session for authentication purposes.
- `deepmerge` is imported from the `@utils/deepmerge` module. It is used to merge the existing application settings with the new settings provided in the request payload.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module. It is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module. It contains the authentication options for the session.
- `getAppSettings` is imported from the `@ui/getAppSettings` module. It is used to retrieve the current application settings.

**Internal Functions:**

- `GET(req: Request, res: Response)`: This function is an async function that handles GET requests. It calls the `getAppSettings` function to retrieve the application settings and returns them as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

- `POST(request: Request)`: This function is an async function that handles POST requests. It first retrieves the server session using `getServerSession` and checks if the user's email is available. If not, it redirects the user to the '/auth' route. If the user's email is available, it retrieves the user from the database using `prisma.user.findUnique` and the email from the session. It then merges the existing application settings with the new settings provided in the request payload using `deepmerge`. Finally, it updates the user's application settings in the database using `prisma.user.update` and returns the updated settings as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

**External Services:**

- The `getAppSettings` function is an external service that retrieves the current application settings. It is not defined in this file.

**API Endpoints:**

     }
     ```

**Interaction Summary:**

The GET endpoint retrieves the current application settings and returns them as a JSON response. The POST endpoint updates the application settings based on the request payload and returns the updated settings as a JSON response.

**Developer Questions:**

1. What is the purpose of the `deepmerge` function and how does it work?
2. How does the authentication process work in this code?
3. What is the structure of the request payload for the POST endpoint?
4. How are the application settings stored in the database?
5. Are there any validation checks or error handling for the request payload in the POST endpoint?

**TODO:**

- Validate user has org update access.
- Remove commented code after enabling user settings.

**Known Issues:**

- None.
