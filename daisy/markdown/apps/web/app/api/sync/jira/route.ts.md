API Summary:
This code file contains a single API endpoint that handles a POST request to the `/api/route` route. It retrieves application settings, server session information, and user data. It then sends a request to an external service called `inngest` with the received data. Finally, it returns a JSON response indicating the success of the operation.

Import statements:
- `getAppSettings` from `@ui/getAppSettings`: This function is used to retrieve the application settings.
- `getServerSession` from `next-auth`: This function is used to retrieve the server session information.
- `authOptions` from `@ui/authOptions`: This object contains options for the authentication process.
- `inngest` from `@utils/ingest/client`: This is the external service used to send data.
- `NextResponse` from `next/server`: This is a utility class for creating responses in Next.js.

Internal Functions:
- `POST`: This is the main function that handles the POST request. It takes a `Request` object as a parameter and performs the following steps:
  1. Retrieves the application settings using `getAppSettings`.
  2. Retrieves the server session information using `getServerSession` with the `authOptions`.
  3. Extracts the user information from the session.
  4. Parses the JSON data from the request body to get the `filters`.
  5. Sends a request to the `inngest` service with the collected data.
  6. Returns a JSON response indicating the success of the operation using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- `inngest`: This is an external service used to send data. It requires the following parameters:
  - `v`: The version of the data being sent.
  - `ts`: The timestamp of the data.
  - `name`: The name of the data.
  - `user`: The user information.
  - `data`: The data to be sent.

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/route
  Summary: This endpoint handles a POST request to the `/api/route` route. It expects a JSON payload with a `filters` property. It retrieves application settings, server session information, and user data. It then sends a request to the `inngest` service with the received data. Finally, it returns a JSON response indicating the success of the operation.
  Example Usage:
  ```
  curl -X POST \
    http://localhost:3000/api/route \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "filters": {
      "property": "value"
    }
  }'
  ```
  Example Response:
  ```json
  {
    "success": "true"
  }
  ```

Interaction Summary:
The code file imports necessary functions and objects from various modules to handle a POST request to the `/api/route` route. It retrieves application settings and server session information, extracts user data, and sends a request to an external service called `inngest` with the collected data. Finally, it returns a JSON response indicating the success of the operation.

Developer Questions:
- What are the required properties in the `filters` object?
- How is the `inngest` service configured and where can I find its documentation?
- Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for the external service request?
- Are there any additional steps or validations required before sending the data to the `inngest` service?

TODO Items:
- Add error handling for the external service request.
- Document the configuration and usage of the `inngest` service.

Known Issues:
- None.
