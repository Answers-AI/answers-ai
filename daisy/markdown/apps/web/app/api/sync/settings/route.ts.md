**Code Documentation:**

API Summary:
This code file contains a single API endpoint that handles a POST request to the `/api` route. The endpoint is responsible for retrieving the server session using NextAuth, sending data to an external service called Inngest, and returning a JSON response indicating success.

Import statements:
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` package. It is used to retrieve the server session.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module. It provides options for the authentication process.
- `inngest` is imported from the `@utils/ingest/client` module. It is used to send data to the external service.
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` package. It is used to construct the response to be sent back to the client.

Internal Functions:
- `POST()` is an async function that serves as the API endpoint handler. It retrieves the server session, extracts the user from the session, sends data to the Inngest service, and returns a JSON response indicating success.

External Services:
- The code interacts with the Inngest service to send data. The `inngest.send()` function is used to send a payload containing the user data to the service.

API Endpoints:
- POST /api
  - Summary: This endpoint handles a POST request to the `/api` route. It retrieves the server session, sends data to the Inngest service, and returns a JSON response indicating success.
  - Example Usage:
    ```
    curl -X POST \
      http://localhost:3000/api \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
      -d '{
      "data": "data"
    }'
    ```
  - Example Response:
    ```json
    {
      "success": "true"
    }
    ```

Interaction Summary:
1. The `POST()` function is called when a POST request is made to the `/api` route.
2. The server session is retrieved using `getServerSession()` and the `authOptions` object.
3. The user is extracted from the session.
4. A payload containing the user data is constructed.
5. The payload is sent to the Inngest service using `inngest.send()`.
6. A JSON response indicating success is constructed using `NextResponse.json()` and returned to the client.

Developer Questions:
- How is the server session retrieved and authenticated?
- What data is sent to the Inngest service?
- Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for the Inngest service?
- Are there any additional parameters that can be passed to the `/api` endpoint?
- How can the success response be customized?
