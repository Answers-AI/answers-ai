API Summary:
This file contains a single API endpoint that handles a POST request to the `/api` route. It retrieves application settings, server session information, and user data. It then returns a JSON response indicating success.

Import statements:
- `getAppSettings` is imported from the `@ui/getAppSettings` module.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module.
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module.

Internal Functions:
- `POST`: This function is the main entry point for the API endpoint. It is an asynchronous function that retrieves the application settings using `getAppSettings()`. It then retrieves the server session using `getServerSession()` with the `authOptions` object. The user data is extracted from the session object. Finally, it returns a JSON response indicating success using `NextResponse.json()`.

External Services:
- `getAppSettings`: This function retrieves the application settings from an external source.
- `getServerSession`: This function retrieves the server session information from the `next-auth` module.

API Endpoints:
- POST /api
  - Summary: This endpoint handles a POST request to the `/api` route. It retrieves application settings, server session information, and user data. It then returns a JSON response indicating success.
  - Example Usage:
    ```
    curl -X POST \
      http://localhost:3000/api \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
      -d '{
      "data": "data"
    }'
    ```
  - Example Response:
    ```json
    {
      "success": "true"
    }
    ```

Interaction Summary:
The code in this file interacts with the following parts of the application:
1. `getAppSettings`: Retrieves the application settings.
2. `getServerSession`: Retrieves the server session information.
3. `NextResponse.json()`: Returns a JSON response indicating success.

Developer Questions:
1. What are the possible responses from the `getAppSettings` function?
2. What information is stored in the `authOptions` object?
3. How is the user data extracted from the session object?
4. Are there any error handling mechanisms in place for potential failures in the code?

TODO Items:
- Uncomment the `syncFromAirtable` function and implement the necessary logic.
- Add error handling for potential failures in the code.

Known Issues:
- None.
