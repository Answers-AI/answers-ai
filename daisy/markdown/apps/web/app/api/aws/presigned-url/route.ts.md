**Code Documentation:**

API Summary:
This code file contains a single API endpoint that handles a POST request to upload a document to an AWS S3 bucket. It requires the user to be logged in and authenticated using NextAuth. The endpoint returns a signed URL that can be used to upload the document to the S3 bucket.

Import statements:
- `getServerSession` from 'next-auth': This function is used to retrieve the server session for the authenticated user.
- `authOptions` from '@ui/authOptions': This is an object that contains the authentication options for NextAuth.
- `NextResponse` and `NextRequest` from 'next/server': These are utility classes provided by Next.js for handling HTTP responses and requests.
- `getSignedUrl` from '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner': This function is used to generate a signed URL for uploading the document to the S3 bucket.
- `S3Client` and `PutObjectCommand` from '@aws-sdk/client-s3': These classes are used to interact with the AWS S3 service.

Internal Functions:
- `POST`: This is the main function that handles the POST request to upload the document. It takes the request object (`req`) and the response object (`res`) as parameters. It performs several checks to ensure that the required environment variables for AWS S3 access are set. Then, it retrieves the server session and checks if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, it returns an error response. Next, it extracts the `documentName` from the request body and checks if it is present. If not, it returns an error response. If all checks pass, it creates an instance of the `S3Client` class with the AWS S3 region and credentials. It then creates a `PutObjectCommand` with the S3 bucket, document name, and content type. Finally, it calls the `getSignedUrl` function to generate a signed URL for the upload and returns it in the response.

External Services:
- AWS S3: This code interacts with the AWS S3 service to upload the document. It requires valid AWS access keys and a configured S3 bucket.

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/upload
  - Summary: This endpoint handles a POST request to upload a document to an AWS S3 bucket. It requires the user to be logged in and authenticated using NextAuth. The endpoint returns a signed URL that can be used to upload the document to the S3 bucket.
  - Example Usage:
    ```
    curl -X POST \
      http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
      "documentName": "example.pdf"
    }'
    ```
  - Example Response:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "ok",
      "signedUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/example-bucket/example.pdf?..."
    }
    ```

Interaction Summary:
The code file imports necessary dependencies for authentication, handling HTTP requests and responses, and interacting with AWS S3. The `POST` function is the main entry point for the API endpoint. It performs checks for valid AWS access keys and a configured S3 bucket. It then retrieves the user session and checks if the user is logged in. If all checks pass, it creates a signed URL for uploading the document to the S3 bucket and returns it in the response.

Developer Questions:
- What are the required environment variables for AWS S3 access?
- How does the authentication with NextAuth work?
- How can I configure the AWS S3 bucket and region?
- What is the purpose of the `authOptions` object?
- How can I handle errors and exceptions in this code?
- Are there any limitations or known issues with the `getSignedUrl` function?

TODO items:
- Add error handling for AWS S3 operations.
- Implement file validation and size restrictions.
- Add logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Known issues:
- None.
