API Summary:
This code file contains a single API endpoint that handles a POST request to '/api/route'. The endpoint expects a JSON payload with the keys 'repo', 'text', and 'filePath'. It authenticates the request using an API key, and if the authentication is successful, it sends the data to an external service called 'inngest'. The endpoint returns a JSON response with a status of 'ok' if the request is successful, or an error message if any of the required keys are missing.

Import statements:
- The code imports the 'NextResponse' class from the 'next/server' module, which is used to construct the response sent back to the client.
- The code imports the 'inngest' function from the '@utils/ingest/client' module, which is an external service used to send data.
- The code imports the 'authenticateApiKey' function from the '@utils/auth/authenticateApiKey' module, which is used to authenticate the API key sent with the request.
- The code imports the 'respond401' function from the '@utils/auth/respond401' module, which is used to send a 401 Unauthorized response if the authentication fails.

Internal Functions:
- POST(req: Request): This is the main function that handles the POST request to '/api/route'. It takes the request object as a parameter and returns a response. It performs the following steps:
  1. Calls the 'authenticateApiKey' function with the request object to authenticate the API key.
  2. If the authentication fails, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response by calling the 'respond401' function.
  3. Parses the request body as JSON using the 'req.json()' method and assigns it to the 'data' variable.
  4. Defines an array of required keys ['repo', 'text', 'filePath'].
  5. Loops through the required keys and checks if each key exists in the 'data' object. If any key is missing, it constructs a JSON response with an error message and a status of 400 Bad Request using the 'NextResponse.json()' method.
  6. Calls the 'inngest.send()' function with the necessary data to send it to the external service 'inngest'.
  7. Returns a JSON response with a status of 'ok' using the 'NextResponse.json()' method.

External Services:
- 'inngest': This is an external service used to send data. The 'inngest.send()' function is called with the necessary data to send it to the service.

API Endpoints:
POST /api/route
Summary: This endpoint handles a POST request to '/api/route'. It expects a JSON payload with the keys 'repo', 'text', and 'filePath'. It authenticates the request using an API key, and if the authentication is successful, it sends the data to an external service called 'inngest'. The endpoint returns a JSON response with a status of 'ok' if the request is successful, or an error message if any of the required keys are missing.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "repo": "my-repo",
  "text": "some text",
  "filePath": "/path/to/file"
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The client sends a POST request to '/api/route' with a JSON payload containing the required keys 'repo', 'text', and 'filePath'.
2. The server receives the request and calls the 'POST' function in the code file.
3. The 'authenticateApiKey' function is called to authenticate the API key sent with the request.
4. If the authentication fails, a 401 Unauthorized response is returned.
5. The request body is parsed as JSON and assigned to the 'data' variable.
6. The code checks if all the required keys exist in the 'data' object. If any key is missing, a 400 Bad Request response is returned.
7. The 'inngest.send()' function is called with the necessary data to send it to the 'inngest' external service.
8. A JSON response with a status of 'ok' is returned.

Developer Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the 'authenticateApiKey' function and how does it work?
2. What happens if the 'inngest.send()' function fails to send the data?
3. Can the list of required keys be customized or extended?
4. Are there any additional error handling mechanisms in place for unexpected errors?

TODO Items:
- Consider adding more detailed error messages for missing keys in the request body.
- Add logging or error tracking for failed 'inngest.send()' calls.

Known Issues:
- None.
