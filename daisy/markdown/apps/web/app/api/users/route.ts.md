API Summary:
This file contains a PATCH endpoint that is responsible for updating user data in a larger application. It requires authentication using NextAuth and Next.js server-side rendering. The endpoint receives a JSON payload containing the user ID and the fields to be updated. It then validates the user's session, checks if the user ID matches the authenticated user, and updates the user data in the database using Prisma. The updated user data, including any updated context fields, is returned as a JSON response.

Import statements:
- `NextResponse` is imported from the `next/server` module and is used to handle the response sent back to the client.
- `getServerSession` is imported from the `next-auth` module and is used to retrieve the authenticated session.
- `prisma` is imported from the `@db/client` module and is used to interact with the database.
- `authOptions` is imported from the `@ui/authOptions` module and contains the authentication options for NextAuth.
- `randomUUID` is imported from the `crypto` module and is used to generate a random UUID for context fields.

Internal Functions:
- `PATCH`: This is the main function that handles the PATCH request. It takes in the `req` (Request) and `res` (Response) objects as parameters. It first retrieves the authenticated session using `getServerSession` and checks if the user's email is available. If not, it redirects the user to the authentication page. It then extracts the `id` and `contextFields` from the JSON payload received in the request. If the user ID in the session does not match the provided ID, it redirects the user to the authentication page. The function then retrieves the list of fields from the Prisma data model and creates a new object `newData` to store the updated data. It iterates over the fields and assigns the corresponding values from the JSON payload to `newData`, converting `null` values to `undefined`. If `contextFields` is provided, it processes each field, removes the `userId` property, and either creates a new context field or updates an existing one using the `fieldId`. Finally, it updates the user data in the database using `prisma.user.update` and includes the updated `contextFields` in the response. The updated user data is returned as a JSON response using `NextResponse.json`.

External Services:
- NextAuth: This module is used for authentication and session management. It provides the `getServerSession` function to retrieve the authenticated session.
- Prisma: This module is used for database access and ORM. It provides the `prisma` object to interact with the database.

API Endpoints:
PATCH /api/route
Summary: This endpoint is responsible for updating user data in the database. It requires authentication and receives a JSON payload containing the user ID and the fields to be updated.

Example Usage:
```
curl -X PATCH \
  http://localhost:3000/api/route \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d '{
  "id": "123",
  "contextFields": [
    {
      "id": "456",
      "fieldId": "789",
      "helpText": "Some help text",
      "fieldType": "text",
      "fieldTextValue": "Some value"
    }
  ],
  "otherField": "Some value"
}'
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "contextFields": [
    {
      "id": "456",
      "fieldId": "789",
      "helpText": "Some help text",
      "fieldType": "text",
      "fieldTextValue": "Some value"
    }
  ]
}
```

Interaction Summary:
1. The PATCH endpoint receives a JSON payload containing the user ID and the fields to be updated.
2. It validates the user's session using NextAuth and redirects to the authentication page if the session is not available or the user's email is not present.
3. It extracts the `id` and `contextFields` from the JSON payload.
4. It checks if the user ID in the session matches the provided ID and redirects to the authentication page if not.
5. It retrieves the list of fields from the Prisma data model.
6. It creates a new object `newData` and assigns the corresponding values from the JSON payload to it, converting `null` values to `undefined`.
7. If `contextFields` is provided, it processes each field, removes the `userId` property, and either creates a new context field or updates an existing one using the `fieldId`.
8. It updates the user data in the database using `prisma.user.update` and includes the updated `contextFields` in the response.
9. It returns the updated user data as a JSON response.

Developer Questions:
1. What are the required fields in the JSON payload for the PATCH request?
2. How does the authentication process work with NextAuth?
3. How are the context fields processed and updated in the database?
4. Are there any additional validation or error handling steps that should be implemented?
5. How can I test this endpoint locally?

TODO items:
- Add input validation for the JSON payload to ensure required fields are present and have the correct data types.
- Implement error handling for database update failures and return appropriate error responses.

Known issues:
- None.
