Summary:
This file is a React component that serves as the layout for the integrations settings page in a larger application. It imports the `getAppSettings` function from the `@ui/getAppSettings` module and the `IntegrationsSettings` component from the `@ui/IntegrationsSettings` module. The component is responsible for fetching the app settings, rendering the integrations settings component, and rendering the children components passed to it.

Import statements:
- `getAppSettings` from `@ui/getAppSettings`: This function is used to fetch the app settings.
- `React` from `react`: This is the core React library.
- `IntegrationsSettings` from `@ui/IntegrationsSettings`: This is the component responsible for rendering the integrations settings.

Component:
The `SettingsIntegrationsAppLayout` component is an asynchronous function that takes in props as an argument. It destructures the `children`, `params`, and `other` props. It then awaits the `getAppSettings` function to fetch the app settings. It extracts the `activeApp` from the `params` prop and renders the `IntegrationsSettings` component with the `appSettings` and `activeApp` props. It also clones and renders the `children` component with the `appSettings` prop.

Hooks:
None.

Event Handlers:
