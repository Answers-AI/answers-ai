Summary:
This file is a React component that serves as the layout for the integrations settings page in a larger application. It imports the `getAppSettings` function from the `@ui/getAppSettings` module and the `IntegrationsSettings` component from the `@ui/IntegrationsSettings` module. The component is responsible for fetching the app settings, rendering the integrations settings component, and rendering the children components passed to it.

Import statements:
- `getAppSettings` from `@ui/getAppSettings`: This function is used to fetch the app settings.
- `React` from `react`: This is the core React library.
- `IntegrationsSettings` from `@ui/IntegrationsSettings`: This is the component responsible for rendering the integrations settings.

Component:
The `SettingsIntegrationsAppLayout` component is an asynchronous function that takes in props as an argument. It destructures the `children`, `params`, and `other` props from the argument. It then calls the `getAppSettings` function to fetch the app settings asynchronously.

The component extracts the `activeApp` value from the `params` prop, which is an array, and assigns it to the `activeApp` variable. It uses the `React.cloneElement` function to clone the `children` component and pass the `appSettings` prop to it.

Hooks:
- None

Event Handlers:
- None

Rendered components:
- `IntegrationsSettings`: This component is rendered with the `appSettings` and `activeApp` props.

Interaction Summary:
This component interacts with other components by rendering the `IntegrationsSettings` component and passing the `appSettings` and `activeApp` props to it. It also renders the children components passed to it, cloning them and passing the `appSettings` prop to them.

Developer Questions:
- How are the `params` prop passed to this component?
- What is the structure of the `appSettings` object returned by the `getAppSettings` function?
- How are the children components passed to this component?
