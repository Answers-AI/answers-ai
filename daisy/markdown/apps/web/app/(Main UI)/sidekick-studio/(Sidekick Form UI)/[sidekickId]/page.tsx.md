Summary:
The provided React file is a client-side component that represents the SidekickDetailPage in a larger application. It is responsible for rendering the details of a sidekick, based on the provided sidekickId parameter. The component interacts with the database using Prisma and handles user authentication using authOptions and getCachedSession.

Import statements:
- React: The core React library.
- prisma: The Prisma client for interacting with the database.
- authOptions: The options for user authentication.
- getCachedSession: A function for retrieving the cached user session.
- SidekickDetail: A sub-component for rendering the details of a sidekick.
- types: A module containing type definitions.

Component:
The SidekickDetailPage component is an async function that takes a params object as a parameter. It first retrieves the user session using getCachedSession and authOptions. If the userId is not available in the session, the component returns null.

The sidekickId is extracted from the params object. If it is not available, the component also returns null.

The component then queries the database using Prisma to find the sidekick with the provided sidekickId. The query includes several conditions to determine the visibility of the sidekick based on the userId and other properties. The result is assigned to the sidekick variable.

Based on the properties of the sidekick, the sharedWith property is set to indicate whether the sidekick is global, shared with an organization, part of the system, or private.

Finally, the SidekickDetail component is rendered with the params and sidekick props.
