Interaction Summary:
The ChatDetailPage component interacts with other components in the application by importing and using the Chat and ChatNotFound UI components. It also uses the Prisma client to fetch data from the database. The component expects to receive the "params" object as a prop, which contains the chatId. It then fetches the chat data from the database using the chatId and includes related information such as the prompt, journey, messages, and users. If the chat or user is not found, it renders the ChatNotFound component.
