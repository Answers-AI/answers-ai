**Prompt:** Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

**File Contents:**
```
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "../../node_modules/.pnpm/typescript@4.9.5/node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true
}
```

**Summary:**
The provided configuration file is used in a larger application to specify certain settings related to TypeScript. It includes two key parameters: `typescript.tsdk` and `typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk`. These parameters define the TypeScript SDK path and enable the use of the workspace TypeScript SDK prompt, respectively.

**Service:**
The configuration file is specific to the TypeScript service, which is a programming language and compiler that allows developers to write JavaScript code with optional static typing. TypeScript provides additional features and tooling to enhance the development experience and catch potential errors at compile-time.

**Configuration Summary:**
The configuration file overrides the default settings related to the TypeScript SDK path and the workspace TypeScript SDK prompt. By specifying the `typescript.tsdk` parameter, the file sets the TypeScript SDK path to `../../node_modules/.pnpm/typescript@4.9.5/node_modules/typescript/lib`. Additionally, the `typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk` parameter is set to `true`, enabling the use of the workspace TypeScript SDK prompt.

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `typescript.tsdk`: Specifies the path to the TypeScript SDK. In this case, it is set to `../../node_modules/.pnpm/typescript@4.9.5/node_modules/typescript/lib`, indicating the location of the TypeScript library within the project's dependencies.
- `typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk`: Determines whether the workspace TypeScript SDK prompt should be enabled or not. When set to `true`, the prompt allows developers to choose the TypeScript version specific to the workspace.

**Interaction Summary:**
The configuration file interacts with the larger application by overriding the default TypeScript SDK path and enabling the workspace TypeScript SDK prompt. These settings affect how the application compiles and handles TypeScript code.

**Developer Questions:**
Developers working with this codebase may have the following questions when debugging or changing this file:
1. What is the purpose of the `typescript.tsdk` parameter, and how does it impact the application?
2. How does enabling the `typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk` parameter affect the development workflow?
3. Can the TypeScript SDK path be customized further, and what are the potential implications?
4. How does the workspace TypeScript SDK prompt work, and what are the benefits of using it?
5. Are there any other configuration parameters related to TypeScript that can be modified in this file?
