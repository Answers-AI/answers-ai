Summary:
This code is a configuration file for a Next.js application. It sets up various plugins and configurations for the application, including Sentry error tracking and Prisma database integration. It also includes webpack configuration for bundling and transpiling the application.

Import statements:
- `PrismaPlugin` is imported from the `experimental-prisma-webpack-plugin` package. This plugin integrates Prisma, a database toolkit, with webpack.
- `webpack` is imported from the `webpack` package. This is the webpack module bundler.
- `withSentryConfig` is imported from the `@sentry/nextjs` package. This function adds Sentry error tracking to the Next.js application.
- `withBundleAnalyzer` is imported from the `@next/bundle-analyzer` package. This function enables bundle analysis for the application.

Script Summary:
The script defines a `nextConfig` object that configures various aspects of the Next.js application. It sets up experimental features, transpiles specific packages, and configures webpack. It also adds plugins and external dependencies to the webpack configuration based on whether the application is running on the server or the client.

Internal Functions:
- `webpack`: This function is a callback that modifies the webpack configuration. It adds external dependencies, plugins, and handles specific configurations for the server-side rendering.

External Functions:
- `withBundleAnalyzer`: This function wraps the `nextConfig` object and enables bundle analysis for the application.
- `withSentryConfig`: This function wraps the `nextConfig` object and adds Sentry error tracking to the application.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the rest of the application by providing the necessary configurations for webpack, Prisma, and Sentry. It ensures that the application is bundled correctly, integrates with the Prisma database, and tracks errors using Sentry.

Developer Questions:
- How can I enable bundle analysis for the application?
- How can I add additional external dependencies to the webpack configuration?
- How can I configure the application to use a different database?
- How can I disable Sentry error tracking for local development?
