Summary:
This code is a custom React hook called `useStreamedResponse` that is used to handle streamed responses from an API. It takes in an object with `answers` and `addAnswer` properties as parameters and returns an object with `isLoading`, `generatedResponse`, and `generateResponse` properties.

Import statements:
- `useState` is imported from the `react` library. It is used to manage state in functional components.

Script Summary:
The script defines a custom React hook called `useStreamedResponse` that handles streamed responses from an API. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the loading state, generated response state, and to update the generated response as chunks of data are received.

Internal Functions:
- `generateResponse`: This function is an asynchronous function that takes in a prompt string and filters as parameters. It sends a POST request to the API with the prompt, answers, and filters. It then reads the response data in chunks and updates the generated response state accordingly. Finally, it adds the generated response to the `answers` array and resets the generated response state.

External Functions:
- `useStreamedResponse`: This is the main function exported by the script. It takes in an object with `answers` and `addAnswer` properties as parameters. It initializes the loading state and the generated response state using the `useState` hook. It defines the `generateResponse` function and returns an object with the loading state, generated response state, and the `generateResponse` function.

Interaction Summary:
This script is a custom hook that can be used in a React component to handle streamed responses from an API. It can be used by passing in an `answers` array and an `addAnswer` function as parameters. The `generateResponse` function can be called to send a prompt and filters to the API and receive the generated response in chunks.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use this hook in a React component?
- What parameters do I need to pass to the `useStreamedResponse` hook?
- How can I handle errors when the API response is not successful?
- How can I modify the code to handle additional data in the response?
