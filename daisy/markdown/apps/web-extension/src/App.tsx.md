Summary:
This file is a React component called "App" that serves as the main component for a larger application. It imports the "syncAi" function from the "useAI" module and uses it to synchronize data with an AI service. The component also includes a function called "getActiveTab" that retrieves the active tab in the browser.

Import statements:
- React: The main React library.
- syncAi: A function imported from the "useAI" module.

Component:
The "App" component is a functional component that serves as the main entry point for the application. It renders a div element with a fixed width and height, and an iframe element inside it. The iframe displays the web application using the URL provided in the environment variable "VITE_APP_URL".

Hooks:
- useEffect: This hook is used to perform an asynchronous operation when the component mounts. It calls the "getActiveTab" function to retrieve the active tab and then calls the "syncAi" function to synchronize data with the AI service. The useEffect hook has an empty dependency array, so it only runs once when the component mounts.

Event Handlers:
None.

Rendered components:
- div: A div element that contains the iframe.
- iframe: An iframe element that displays the web application using the URL provided in the environment variable "VITE_APP_URL".

Interaction Summary:
The "App" component interacts with the rest of the application by synchronizing data with the AI service. It retrieves the active tab and passes its URL to the "syncAi" function. The component also renders the web application inside an iframe.

Developer Questions:
- How does the "getActiveTab" function work and what does it return?
- What is the purpose of the commented-out useEffect hook?
- How does the "syncAi" function synchronize data with the AI service?
- What are the props used by the "iframe" component and where are they defined?

Known Issues and Todo Items:
- There are no known issues or bugs with the component.
- The todo item is to use the same component as the web app instead of the iframe.
