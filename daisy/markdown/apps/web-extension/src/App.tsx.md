Summary:
This file is a React component called "App" that serves as the main component for a larger application. It imports the "syncAi" function from the "useAI" module and uses it to synchronize data with an AI service. The component also includes a function called "getActiveTab" that retrieves the active tab in the browser.

Import statements:
- React: The React library is imported to use React components and hooks.
- syncAi: The syncAi function is imported from the "./useAI" module.

Component:
The "App" component is a functional component that renders the main content of the application. It includes a useEffect hook that runs once when the component is mounted. Inside the useEffect hook, an async function is called to get the active tab in the browser. If a tab is found, the syncAi function is called with the tab's URL. Any errors that occur during this process are logged to the console.

Hooks:
- useEffect: This hook is used to run the synchronization process when the component is mounted. It has an empty dependency array, so it only runs once.

Event Handlers:
None.

Rendered components:
- div: This div element serves as a container for the main content of the application. It has a fixed width and height and is set to hide any overflow.
- iframe: This iframe element renders the web application using the URL specified in the import.meta.env.VITE_APP_URL variable. It occupies the entire width and height of its parent container and has no border.

Interaction Summary:
The "App" component interacts with other components in the application by rendering the main content and synchronizing data with an AI service. It relies on the "syncAi" function from the "useAI" module to perform the synchronization. The component also retrieves the active tab in the browser to determine the URL to be used for synchronization.

Developer Questions:
- How does the "syncAi" function work and what data does it synchronize with the AI service?
- How is the active tab retrieved and what happens if no tab is found?
- What is the purpose of the iframe and how is the web application URL determined?

Known Issues / Todo Items:
- The second useEffect hook is commented out and its purpose is unclear. It should be reviewed and potentially removed or uncommented if necessary.
