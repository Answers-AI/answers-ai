Summary:
This file represents a React component called "App" that is part of a larger application. It is a client-side component that renders a Box component from the Material-UI library. The component also includes an iframe element that loads a webpage from a specified URL.

Import statements:
- React: The main React library.
- Box: A component from the Material-UI library that provides a flexible container.

Component:
The App component is a functional component that renders a Box component containing an iframe. It also includes a useEffect hook that sets up a message listener using the chrome.runtime API. The useEffect hook is used to add and remove the message listener when the component mounts and unmounts.

Hooks:
- useEffect: This hook is used to set up the message listener using the chrome.runtime API. It takes a callback function as its first argument and an empty dependency array as its second argument. The callback function defines the messageListener and adds it to the chrome.runtime.onMessage event listener. It also returns a cleanup function that removes the messageListener from the event listener when the component unmounts.

Event Handlers:
- messageListener: This function is the callback function used in the useEffect hook. It takes three parameters: message, sender, and sendResponse. It is currently commented out and does not perform any actions.

Rendered components:
- Box: This component is imported from the Material-UI library and is used as a container for other components. It has various styling properties defined using the sx prop.
- iframe: This HTML element is rendered inside the Box component and loads a webpage from the specified URL.

Interaction Summary:
The App component interacts with the chrome.runtime API by setting up a message listener. It listens for messages sent by other parts of the application or external sources. Currently, the component does not perform any actions when a message is received.

Developer Questions:
- How can I customize the styling of the Box component?
- How can I handle the received messages and perform actions based on their content?
- How can I pass data from the App component to the iframe component?

Known Issues / Todo:
- The messageListener function is currently commented out and does not perform any actions. It needs to be implemented to handle received messages.
- There are no known issues or bugs with the component at the moment.
