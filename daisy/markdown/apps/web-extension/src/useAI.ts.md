Summary:
This code is a React hook called `useAI` that provides functionality for interacting with an AI model. It allows users to set filters, provide prompts, and receive generated responses from the AI model. The code also includes a separate function called `syncAi` that performs a synchronous AI request.

Import statements:
- `useQuery` is imported from `@tanstack/react-query` and is used for making API requests and managing the state of the data.
- `axios` is imported and is used for making HTTP requests to the API.
- `useState` and `useCallback` are imported from `react` and are used for managing state within the hook.
- `useStreamedResponse` is imported from a local file called `useStreamedResponse` and is used for handling streamed responses from the AI model.

Script Summary:
The script defines a React hook called `useAI` that provides functionality for interacting with an AI model. It also includes a separate function called `syncAi` that performs a synchronous AI request.

Internal Functions:
- `useAI`: This is the main function of the script and is a React hook. It takes an optional `options` object as a parameter, which can include `useStreaming` and `filters` properties. It initializes state variables for `filters`, `prompt`, and `answers`. It also defines a function called `addAnswer` that adds an answer to the `answers` state array. The function then uses the `useStreamedResponse` hook to handle streamed responses from the AI model. It also includes state variables for `useStreaming` and `isLoading`. The function uses the `useQuery` hook to make API requests to the AI model, passing the `prompt`, `answers`, and `filters` as parameters. It returns an object with various state variables and functions related to the AI model.

External Functions:
- `syncAi`: This function takes an optional `options` object as a parameter, which can include a `url` property. It makes a synchronous API request to the AI model using the `axios` library. It returns the response data.

Interaction Summary:
The `useAI` hook can be used within a React component to interact with an AI model. It provides state variables and functions for setting filters, providing prompts, and receiving generated responses from the AI model. The `syncAi` function can be used to perform a synchronous AI request.
