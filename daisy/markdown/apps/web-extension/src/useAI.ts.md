Summary:
This code is a React hook called `useAI` that provides functionality for interacting with an AI model. It allows users to set filters, provide prompts, and receive generated responses from the AI model. The code also includes a separate function called `syncAi` that performs a synchronous AI request.

Import statements:
- `useQuery` is imported from `@tanstack/react-query` and is used for making API requests and managing the state of the data.
- `axios` is imported and is used for making HTTP requests to the API.
- `useState` and `useCallback` are imported from `react` and are used for managing state within the React component.
- `useStreamedResponse` is imported from a local file called `useStreamedResponse` and is used for handling streamed responses from the AI model.

Script Summary:
The script defines a React hook called `useAI` that returns an object with various properties and functions related to interacting with an AI model. It also defines a separate function called `syncAi` that performs a synchronous AI request.

Internal Functions:
- `useAI`: This is a React hook that takes an optional `options` object as a parameter. It initializes state variables for `filters`, `prompt`, and `answers`. It also defines a function `addAnswer` that adds a new answer to the `answers` state array. The hook then uses the `useStreamedResponse` hook to manage the state of the AI model's generated response. It also uses the `useQuery` hook to make API requests to the AI model. The hook returns an object with various properties and functions related to interacting with the AI model.

External Functions:
- `syncAi`: This is an asynchronous function that takes an optional `options` object as a parameter. It performs a synchronous AI request by making a POST request to a specified URL. It returns the response data from the request.

Interaction Summary:
The `useAI` hook can be used within a React component to provide AI functionality. It can be used to set filters, provide prompts, and receive generated responses from the AI model. The `syncAi` function can be used to perform a synchronous AI request.

Developer Questions:
- How can I use the `useAI` hook within a React component?
- What properties and functions are available in the object returned by the `useAI` hook?
- How can I modify the `syncAi` function to use a different URL for the API request?
