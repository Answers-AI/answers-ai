**Prompt:** Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

**File Contents:**
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Node",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "include": ["vite.config.ts"]
}
```

**Summary:**
This configuration file is used to specify various options and settings for the compiler in a larger application. It includes options related to module resolution, composite projects, and synthetic default imports.

**Service:**
The configuration file is not specific to a known service. It is generally used in applications that utilize a compiler, such as TypeScript.

**Configuration Summary:**
The configuration file overrides the default compiler options and sets the following settings:
- `composite` is set to `true`, enabling the use of composite projects.
- `module` is set to `"ESNext"`, specifying the target module system as ECMAScript modules.
- `moduleResolution` is set to `"Node"`, indicating that module resolution should follow Node.js resolution rules.
- `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` is set to `true`, allowing the use of synthetic default imports.

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `compilerOptions`: This section contains various options related to the compiler.
  - `composite`: When set to `true`, enables the use of composite projects, which allows multiple TypeScript projects to be built together.
  - `module`: Specifies the target module system. In this case, it is set to `"ESNext"`, indicating the use of ECMAScript modules.
  - `moduleResolution`: Determines how modules are resolved. Setting it to `"Node"` means that module resolution follows Node.js resolution rules.
  - `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`: When set to `true`, allows the use of synthetic default imports, which is useful when working with modules that don't have a default export.

- `include`: Specifies the files or patterns to include in the compilation process. In this case, it includes the file `"vite.config.ts"`.

**Interaction Summary:**
This configuration file affects the behavior of the compiler in the application. It enables composite projects, sets the module system to ECMAScript modules, specifies Node.js module resolution rules, and allows synthetic default imports. These settings can impact how the application is built and how modules are resolved.

**Developer Questions:**
Developers working with this code base may have the following questions when debugging or changing this file:
1. What is the purpose of composite projects, and why is it enabled in this configuration?
2. How does setting the module system to "ESNext" affect the application's code?
3. What are the differences between different module resolution options, and why is "Node" chosen here?
4. What are synthetic default imports, and why are they allowed in this configuration?
5. How does including the file "vite.config.ts" impact the compilation process?
