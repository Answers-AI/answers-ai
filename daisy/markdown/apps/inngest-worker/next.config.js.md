Summary:
This code is a configuration file for a Next.js application. It sets up various configurations and plugins for the application, including bundle analysis, transpilation packages, and webpack settings. It also includes an optional integration with Sentry for error tracking.

Import statements:
- `PrismaPlugin` from 'experimental-prisma-webpack-plugin': This is a plugin for webpack that integrates Prisma, a database toolkit, with the application.
- `webpack` from 'webpack': This is the webpack module, which is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications.
- `withSentryConfig` from '@sentry/nextjs': This is a function that configures the Next.js application to work with Sentry, an error tracking tool.
- `withBundleAnalyzer` from '@next/bundle-analyzer': This is a function that enables bundle analysis for the application.

Script Summary:
The script defines a configuration object `nextConfig` that includes various settings for the Next.js application. It also modifies the webpack configuration by adding plugins and externals. Finally, it conditionally integrates Sentry into the application based on the `DISABLE_SENTRY` environment variable.

Internal Functions:
- `webpack`: This is a function that modifies the webpack configuration. It adds external dependencies, such as 'puppeteer' and 'canvas', and includes plugins, such as `PrismaPlugin` and `IgnorePlugin`. It also checks if the configuration is for the server and adds the `PrismaPlugin` in that case.

External Functions:
- `withBundleAnalyzer`: This function takes a configuration object and returns a modified configuration object with bundle analysis enabled if the `ANALYZE` environment variable is set to 'true'.
- `withSentryConfig`: This function takes a configuration object and returns a modified configuration object with Sentry integration enabled.
