**API Summary:**

This code file sets up a server using the Inngest library and defines various API endpoints for handling events. It imports several utility functions for handling different types of events from external modules. The server listens for incoming events and routes them to the appropriate handler function based on the event type.

**Import statements:**

- `import { Inngest } from 'inngest';`: Imports the `Inngest` class from the 'inngest' module, which is used to create a client for sending and receiving events.
- `import { serve } from 'inngest/next';`: Imports the `serve` function from the 'inngest/next' module, which is used to start the server and handle incoming requests.
- `import { createInngestFunctions } from '@utils/ingest/EventVersionHandler';`: Imports the `createInngestFunctions` function from the '@utils/ingest/EventVersionHandler' module, which is used to create the event handler functions for the server.
- `import * as algoliaFunctions from '@utils/ingest/algolia';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/algolia' module, which contains utility functions for handling Algolia events.
- `import * as authFunctions from '@utils/ingest/auth';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/auth' module, which contains utility functions for handling authentication events.
- `import * as confluenceFunctions from '@utils/ingest/confluence';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/confluence' module, which contains utility functions for handling Confluence events.
- `import * as embeddingsFunctions from '@utils/ingest/embeddings';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/embeddings' module, which contains utility functions for handling embeddings events.
- `import * as messageFunctions from '@utils/ingest/message';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/message' module, which contains utility functions for handling message events.
- `import * as openApiFunctions from '@utils/ingest/openapi';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/openapi' module, which contains utility functions for handling OpenAPI events.
- `import * as promptFunctions from '@utils/ingest/prompt';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/prompt' module, which contains utility functions for handling prompt events.
- `import * as slackFunctions from '@utils/ingest/slack';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/slack' module, which contains utility functions for handling Slack events.
- `import * as webFunctions from '@utils/ingest/web';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/web' module, which contains utility functions for handling web events.
- `import * as jiraFunctions from '@utils/ingest/jira';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/jira' module, which contains utility functions for handling Jira events.
- `import * as fileFunctions from '@utils/ingest/file';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/file' module, which contains utility functions for handling file events.
- `import * as airtableFunctions from '@utils/ingest/airtable';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/airtable' module, which contains utility functions for handling Airtable events.
- `import * as codebaseFunctions from '@utils/ingest/codebase';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/codebase' module, which contains utility functions for handling codebase events.
- `import * as documentFunctions from '@utils/ingest/document';`: Imports all functions from the '@utils/ingest/document' module, which contains utility functions for handling document events.

**Internal Functions:**

- `createInngestFunctions(functions as any)`: This function takes an array of event handler functions and returns an object with the event types as keys and the corresponding handler functions as values. It is used to create the event handler functions for the server.

**External Services:**

This code file interacts with the following external services:

- Inngest: The `Inngest` class is used to create a client for sending and receiving events. It is initialized with the name of the application.

**API Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/route`

  Summary: This endpoint handles incoming events and routes them to the appropriate handler function based on the event type.

  Example Usage:
  ```
  curl -X POST \
    http://localhost:3000/api/route \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
    -d '{
    "event": "algolia",
    "data": {
      "query": "example"
    }
  }'
  ```

  Example Response:
  ```json
  {
    "response": "Handled Algolia event"
  }
  ```

**Interaction Summary:**

The code sets up a server using the Inngest library and defines various API endpoints for handling events. When an event is received at the `/api/route` endpoint, the server routes it to the appropriate handler function based on the event type. The handler function processes the event and returns a response.

**Developer Questions:**

- How are the event handler functions defined and where are they located?
- How can I add a new event type and corresponding handler function?
- How can I modify the response sent back to the client for a specific event type?

**TODO:**

- Add error handling for invalid event types.
- Improve documentation for the event handler functions.

**Known Issues:**

- None.
