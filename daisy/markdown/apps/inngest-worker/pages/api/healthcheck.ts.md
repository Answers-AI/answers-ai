**Code Breakdown:**

The provided code is a TypeScript file that exports a single function named `healthCheck`. This function serves as an API endpoint for a larger application. It takes two parameters: `req` (NextApiRequest) and `res` (NextApiResponse), which represent the incoming request and the outgoing response, respectively.

The `healthCheck` function logs a message to the console, indicating that the worker is healthy, and then sends a response with the string "ok".

**API Summary:**

This API endpoint serves as a health check for the application. It can be used to verify that the worker is running and responding properly.

**Import Statements:**

The code imports two objects, `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse`, from the 'next' module. These objects are used to handle incoming requests and send responses, respectively.

**Internal Functions:**

The `healthCheck` function does not call any internal functions. It simply logs a message and sends a response.

**External Services:**

The code does not interact with any external services. It only handles the incoming request and sends a response.

**API Endpoints:**

There is a single API endpoint in this file:
