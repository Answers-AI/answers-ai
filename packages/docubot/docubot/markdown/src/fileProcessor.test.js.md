Summary:
This file contains code for processing files in a directory, identifying their file type, and determining if they are invalid. It also includes tests for these functions.

Import statements:
The code imports the following modules:
- fs: a Node.js module for interacting with the file system
- path: a Node.js module for working with file paths
- fileProcessor, getFileType, isInvalidFile: functions from the local file 'fileProcessor.js'
- getTemplateFiles: a function from the local file 'getTemplateFiles.js'
- jest: a testing framework for JavaScript

Script Summary:
The code defines a configuration object with various properties related to file processing. It then defines a test suite for the 'fileProcessor' function, which processes files in a directory and returns an array of objects containing information about each file. The test suite includes a mock implementation for the 'getTemplateFiles' function. The code also includes test suites for the 'getFileType' and 'isInvalidFile' functions.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- fileProcessor: a function that takes a directory path and a configuration object as arguments, and returns an array of objects containing information about each file in the directory. Each object includes the file path, file type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion properties.
- getFileType: a function that takes a file path and a configuration object as arguments, and returns an object containing information about the file type, including the type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion properties.
- isInvalidFile: a function that takes a file path and a configuration object as arguments, and returns a boolean indicating whether the file is invalid based on the configuration object.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by providing functions for processing files and identifying their file types. These functions could be used in other parts of the application that involve working with files.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the configuration object, and how is it used in the file processing functions?
- How does the 'getTemplateFiles' function work, and why is it necessary for the 'fileProcessor' function?
- What other file types could be added to the configuration object, and how would they be processed by the 'fileProcessor' function?
- How are the 'readdir', 'stat', and 'readFile' functions from the 'fs' module used in the 'fileProcessor' function?
- How are the 'jest.mock' functions used in the test suites for this file?
