Summary:
This file contains a test suite for the utility functions used in the larger application. It tests the functionality of the countTokens, getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize, getEstimatedPricing, and generateCostSummary functions. 

Import statements:
The file imports the following modules:
- utils: the module containing the utility functions being tested
- fs: the file system module for reading and writing files
- Handlebars: a templating engine
- GPT3Tokenizer: a third-party module for tokenizing text using the GPT-3 language model

Script Summary:
The test suite contains four tests:
- countTokens: tests the countTokens function by comparing the expected token count to the actual token count returned by the function
- compileCompletionPrompts: currently commented out, this test will test the compileCompletionPrompts function by mocking the fileReader and templateCompiler and testing the compiled prompt
- getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize: tests the getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize function by comparing the expected model to the model returned by the function for different token sizes
- getEstimatedPricing: tests the getEstimatedPricing function by comparing the expected price to the price returned by the function for different models and token sizes
- generateCostSummary: currently commented out, this test will test the generateCostSummary function by passing in an array of files and testing the summary output

Internal Functions:
There are no internal functions in this file.

External Functions:
There are no external functions in this file.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the rest of the application by testing the utility functions used in other parts of the application. It ensures that these functions are working as expected and can be relied upon by other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
- What is the purpose of the countTokens function and how is it used in the application?
- How does the getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize function determine which model to use based on token size?
- What is the expected output of the generateCostSummary function and how is it used in the application?
- How does the application handle errors thrown by the third-party GPT3Tokenizer module?
