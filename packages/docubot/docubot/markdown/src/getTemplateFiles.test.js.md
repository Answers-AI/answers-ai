Template:

Summary:
This file contains two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`, which are used to read and return the content of template files. The file also includes Jest tests for both functions.

Import statements:
The file imports the following modules:
- `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile` from the `./getTemplateFiles` module
- `fs` from the Node.js `fs` module
- `path` from the Node.js `path` module

Script Summary:
The file defines two functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in a file path, `fs`, and `path` as parameters. It uses `fs` and `path` to read the content of all the files in the directory specified by the file path, and returns an object with the content of each file, where the keys are the file names without their extensions.
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in `fs` and a file path as parameters. It uses `fs` to read the content of the file at the specified path, and returns the content as a string.

Internal Functions:
- None

External Functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in a file path, `fs`, and `path` as parameters. It returns an object with the content of each file in the directory specified by the file path, where the keys are the file names without their extensions.
  - Parameters:
    - `filePath`: A string representing the path to the directory containing the template files.
    - `fs`: The Node.js `fs` module.
    - `path`: The Node.js `path` module.
  - Returns:
    - An object with the content of each file in the directory specified by the file path, where the keys are the file names without their extensions.
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in `fs` and a file path as parameters. It returns the content of the file at the specified path as a string.
  - Parameters:
    - `fs`: The Node.js `fs` module.
    - `filePath`: A string representing the path to the file to be read.
  - Returns:
    - The content of the file at the specified path as a string.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to read and return the content of template files. It could be used in conjunction with other modules to generate dynamic content based on the templates.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the template files?
- What happens if the file path passed to `getTemplateFiles` or `readTemplateFile` is invalid?
- How can I modify the behavior of these functions to handle different file types or extensions?
- How can I mock the behavior of `fs` and `path` in my own tests for modules that use these functions?
