Template:

Summary:
This file exports two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`, which are used to read and retrieve the contents of template files.

Import statements:
The file imports the `fs` and `path` modules.

Script Summary:
The script exports two functions, `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`, which are used to read and retrieve the contents of template files. `getTemplateFiles` takes in a file path and uses `fs.readdir` to read the contents of the directory. It then loops through each file in the directory, reads the contents of the file using `readTemplateFile`, and adds the contents to an object with the file name as the key. `readTemplateFile` takes in a file path and uses `fs.readFile` to read the contents of the file.

Internal Functions:
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in two parameters, `fs` and `filePath`. It uses `fs.readFile` to read the contents of the file at `filePath` and returns the contents.
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in three parameters, `templateFilePath`, `fsModule`, and `pathModule`. It uses `fsModule.readdir` to read the contents of the directory at `templateFilePath`. It then loops through each file in the directory, reads the contents of the file using `readTemplateFile`, and adds the contents to an object with the file name as the key. It returns the object containing the file contents.

External Functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes in three parameters, `templateFilePath`, `fsModule`, and `pathModule`. It returns an object containing the contents of each file in the directory at `templateFilePath`, with the file name as the key.
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes in two parameters, `fs` and `filePath`. It returns the contents of the file at `filePath`.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to read and retrieve the contents of template files. It could potentially be used in a larger application to generate dynamic content based on the contents of the template files.

Developer Questions:
- What is the expected format of the template files?
- How are the template files used in the rest of the application?
- What happens if a file in the directory is not a valid template file?
- How can I test the functionality of these functions?
