Summary:
This file is the main entry point for the application. It imports necessary dependencies and functions from other files and defines the main function that runs the application. The script prompts the user to confirm if they want to proceed with the operation and then processes files, generates a cost summary, splits files, sends files for documentation, and memorizes files.

Import statements:
- dotenv: loads environment variables from a .env file
- path: provides utilities for working with file and directory paths
- readline: provides an interface for reading input from a readable stream (such as process.stdin) and writing output to a writable stream (such as process.stdout)
- init: a function that initializes the application by loading configuration files and setting up necessary variables
- fileProcessor, batchCompletionProcessor, batchEmbeddingsProcessor, splitFiles, writeResponsesToFile: functions that process files and send them to OpenAI for documentation and memorization
- generateCostSummary: a function that generates a summary of the cost of processing files

Script Summary:
The main function initializes the application, processes files, generates a cost summary, prompts the user to confirm if they want to proceed, splits files, sends files for documentation, and memorizes files.

Internal Functions:
- main: the main function that runs the application. It initializes the application, processes files, generates a cost summary, prompts the user to confirm if they want to proceed, splits files, sends files for documentation, and memorizes files. It returns nothing.

External Functions:
- main: the only external function that is exported. It is the main entry point for the application.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with other files in the application by importing necessary functions and dependencies. It also interacts with the user by prompting them to confirm if they want to proceed with the operation.
