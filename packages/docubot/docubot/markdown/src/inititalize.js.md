Summary:
This file contains functions to initialize and copy configuration files, prompts, and templates for a larger application.

Import statements:
The file imports the built-in Node.js modules `fs` and `path`.

Script Summary:
The file exports four functions: `init`, `initConfigFile`, `initPromptsFolder`, and `initTemplatesFolder`. The `init` function calls the `initConfigFile`, `initPromptsFolder`, and `initTemplatesFolder` functions and returns a Promise that resolves with the configuration object. The `initConfigFile` function copies a default configuration file to the specified folder path if it does not exist and returns the configuration object. The `initPromptsFolder` and `initTemplatesFolder` functions copy the prompts and templates folders to the specified folder path if they do not exist.

Internal Functions:
- `copyFolderSync`: A helper function to copy a folder recursively. It takes two parameters, the source folder path and the destination folder path, and returns nothing.

External Functions:
- `init`: Initializes the configuration, prompts, and templates folders for the application. It takes one parameter, the folder path, and returns a Promise that resolves with the configuration object.
- `initConfigFile`: Initializes the configuration file for the application. It takes one parameter, the folder path, and returns the configuration object.
- `initPromptsFolder`: Initializes the prompts folder for the application. It takes two parameters, the configuration object and the folder path, and returns nothing.
- `initTemplatesFolder`: Initializes the templates folder for the application. It takes two parameters, the configuration object and the folder path, and returns nothing.

Interaction Summary:
This file is used to initialize and copy configuration files, prompts, and templates for a larger application. It can be used in conjunction with other files to set up the application environment.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the configuration file?
- What is the purpose of the prompts and templates folders?
- How can I modify the default configuration file?
- How can I add new prompts or templates to the application?
