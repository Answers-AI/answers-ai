Summary:
This file, openai-api.js, exports two functions: createEmbedding and createChatCompletion. These functions use the OpenAI API to create embeddings and chat completions respectively.

Import statements:
This file imports the Configuration and OpenAIApi classes from the 'openai' package.

Script Summary:
This script exports two functions: createEmbedding and createChatCompletion. createEmbedding takes a model and a file object as parameters and returns an object containing the file path and the response from the OpenAI API. createChatCompletion takes a gptModel, prompt, and temperature as parameters and returns a completion object from the OpenAI API.

Internal Functions:
- createEmbedding: This function takes a model and a file object as parameters. If the file object has contents, it sends a request to the OpenAI API to create an embedding and returns an object containing the file path and the response from the API. If the file object does not have contents, it returns an object containing the file path and null for the response.

- createChatCompletion: This function takes a gptModel, prompt, and temperature as parameters. It creates an array of messages containing a system message and the user prompt. It then sends a request to the OpenAI API to create a chat completion using the gptModel, messages, and temperature. If successful, it returns the completion object from the API. If unsuccessful, it logs an error message to the console.

External Functions:
- createEmbedding: This function takes a model and a file object as parameters and returns an object containing the file path and the response from the OpenAI API.

- createChatCompletion: This function takes a gptModel, prompt, and temperature as parameters and returns a completion object from the OpenAI API.

Interaction Summary:
This file interacts with the OpenAI API to create embeddings and chat completions. It may be used in other parts of the application to generate responses to user prompts or to analyze text data.

Developer Questions:
- What is the format of the file object passed to createEmbedding?
- What is the expected format of the response from the OpenAI API for createEmbedding?
- What is the expected format of the response from the OpenAI API for createChatCompletion?
- How can I test createChatCompletion with different prompts and temperatures?
- What happens if the OpenAI API returns an error in createChatCompletion or createEmbedding?
