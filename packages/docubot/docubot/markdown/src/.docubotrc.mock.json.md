Summary:
This is a configuration file for an application that uses a tool called Docubot. The file specifies various settings for Docubot to use when generating documentation for the application's codebase.

Service:
Docubot is a tool for generating documentation from code comments and files. It can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks.

Configuration Summary:
This configuration file sets various parameters for Docubot to use when generating documentation. It specifies the base path for the code, the name of the Pinecone index to use, and the namespace for the Pinecone index. It also sets various paths for Docubot to use when finding files to document, and specifies which file types and names to exclude.

Configuration Breakdown:
- `codeBasePath`: The base path for the code to document.
- `pineconeIndexName`: The name of the Pinecone index to use.
- `pineconeNamespace`: The namespace for the Pinecone index.
- `docubotDirectoryName`: The name of the directory where Docubot is installed.
- `docubotDirectory`: The path to the directory where Docubot is installed.
